# Workflow State (STM) - [2025-01-21 21:25:00]

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: [as defined]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

**Automatic Rules Applied by AI:**
- **RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01:** When ## 6. Log exceeds 5000 chars, summarize key points to ## 8. ArchiveLog and clear ## 6. Log
- **RULE_SUMMARY_01:** When `Status = COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`, add summary to project changelog
- **RULE_BACKUP_01:** Before major file modifications in CONSTRUCT, create backup entries in ## 7. Backup Log
- **RULE_CONTEXT_REFRESH_01:** After 3 consecutive failures on same issue, refresh context using Context7 with updated queries
- **üö® RULE_TIMEOUT_PROTECTION:** **MANDATORY**: Check timeout threshold, set is_background=false, monitor execution time, log timeouts in ## 5. Items
- **RULE_TIMEOUT_RECOVERY_01:** Command exceeds defined timeout threshold ‚Üí Terminate command immediately, log timeout error with classification, apply progressive retry strategy with conservative parameters
