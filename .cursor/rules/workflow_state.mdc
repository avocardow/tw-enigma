# Workflow State (STM) - [2025-01-21 21:47:00]

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: [as defined]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- üéØ **MISSION:** WINDOWS CI REGRESSION FIX - ‚úÖ COMPLETED! üéâ
- üìä **RESULTS:** Fixed all 41 Windows CI issues (100% success)
- üîÑ **NEW FOCUS:** Investigate performance test stability issue

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `VALIDATE`
- **Status:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** Windows CI Regression Fix - 41 failing tests - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Parsed Task Description:** Successfully resolved Windows CI regression with comprehensive cross-platform fixes. All 41 Windows-specific test failures resolved.
- **Implementation Priority:** `completed` - Mission accomplished
- **Dependencies:** Cross-platform compatibility ‚úÖ, File system handling ‚úÖ, Test infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **Complexity Assessment:** `resolved` - All Windows compatibility issues fixed
- **Status:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS` - Windows CI completely restored

## 3. Plan
üö® **WINDOWS CI REGRESSION - COMPREHENSIVE FIX REQUIRED**

**Failure Categories Identified:**
1. **Path Separator Issues (7 tests):**
   - `fileDiscovery.test.ts`: Unix paths (`/`) vs Windows paths (`\`)
   - `pathUtils.test.ts`: Path normalization expecting forward slashes

2. **File Permission Issues (13 tests):**
   - `AtomicFileWriter.test.ts`: Unix permission modes not matching Windows
   - Windows file permission system differs from Unix octal permissions

3. **File Locking Issues (19 tests):**
   - `EPERM` errors on Windows when renaming/accessing files
   - Atomic operations failing due to Windows file locking constraints
   - Stream optimizer test cleanup failing with `ENOTEMPTY` errors

4. **Test Infrastructure Issues (2 tests):**
   - Directory cleanup on Windows requiring retry logic
   - File system operation timing differences

**Implementation Plan:**

**Step 1: Cross-Platform Path Handling**
- Fix `pathUtils.normalizePath()` to handle platform-specific paths correctly
- Update test expectations to handle Windows vs Unix path separators
- Add platform detection utility for test assertions

**Step 2: File Permission Compatibility**
- Add Windows permission mapping in atomic operations
- Skip or modify permission tests on Windows platform
- Implement platform-specific permission verification

**Step 3: Windows File Locking Fixes**
- Enhance retry logic for Windows EPERM/EBUSY errors
- Add exponential backoff for atomic file operations
- Implement robust cleanup with Windows-specific constraints

**Step 4: Test Infrastructure Enhancement**
- Add Windows-specific test utilities
- Implement platform-aware cleanup functions
- Add retry mechanisms for test setup/teardown

**Step 5: Validation & Deployment**
- Run full test suite locally (simulating Windows behavior where possible)
- Deploy fixes to GitHub for CI validation
- Monitor Windows CI pipeline success

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/pathUtils.ts` - Cross-platform path handling
- `tests/pathUtils.test.ts` - Platform-aware test expectations
- `tests/fileDiscovery.test.ts` - Windows path separator handling
- `src/atomicOps/*.ts` - Windows file locking and permission fixes
- `tests/atomicOps/*.test.ts` - Platform-specific test adjustments
- `tests/performance/streamOptimizer.test.ts` - Windows cleanup fixes
- Test utilities for Windows compatibility
