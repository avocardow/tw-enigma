# Workflow State (STM) - [2025-01-21 23:25:00]

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: [as defined]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- üéØ **MISSION:** CI RELEASE REGRESSION FIX - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- üìä **CURRENT STATUS:** All 22 CLI test failures resolved (100% success rate)
- üîÑ **PRIORITY:** Mission accomplished - release workflow fixed and ready

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION`
- **Status:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** CI Release Test Errors - Build Order Fix
- **Parsed Task Description:** Fixed CI Release workflow where tests run before build, causing CLI tests to fail because dist/enigma.js doesn't exist
- **Implementation Priority:** `completed` - Critical CI issue resolved
- **Dependencies:** GitHub workflow configuration ‚úÖ, Package.json build scripts ‚úÖ
- **Complexity Assessment:** `low` - Simple workflow step reordering completed
- **Status:** `CI_REGRESSION_RESOLVED` - Release workflow fixed

## 3. Plan
üéâ **CI RELEASE REGRESSION FIX - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!**

**‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:**

The CI Release regression has been successfully fixed by reordering the workflow steps in `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

**PROBLEM RESOLVED:**
- ‚ùå **Before:** Release workflow ran `pnpm test` **before** `pnpm build`
- ‚úÖ **After:** Release workflow now runs `pnpm build` **before** `pnpm test`
- ‚úÖ **Result:** CLI tests can now find `dist/enigma.js` that's created during build

**ROOT CAUSE FIXED:**
- Fixed `.github/workflows/release.yml` step order to match working CI workflow
- Moved "Build package" step BEFORE "Run tests" step
- Ensured CLI executable exists before tests attempt to use it

**VALIDATION RESULTS:**
- ‚úÖ All 21 CLI tests now passing (tests/cli.test.ts)
- ‚úÖ All 30 CSS optimization CLI tests now passing (tests/output/cssOptimizationCli.test.ts)  
- ‚úÖ Build generates `dist/enigma.js` successfully (439.26 KB)
- ‚úÖ All 22 previously failing CLI tests now resolved

**FILES SUCCESSFULLY MODIFIED:**
- ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Reordered build before tests

**IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:**
```yaml
# FIXED ORDER (now matches working CI workflow):
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
- name: Build package      # ‚úÖ MOVED TO RUN FIRST  
  run: pnpm build
- name: Run tests          # ‚úÖ NOW RUNS AFTER BUILD
  run: pnpm test
```

**RELEASE WORKFLOW NOW MIRRORS WORKING CI:**
- Both workflows now follow same build-then-test pattern
- Prevents module not found errors for CLI components
- Ensures consistent behavior across all CI environments

## 4. Rules for Current Phase

---
**Phase: `TASK_VALIDATION` - CI Release Build Order Fix**
- **üö® CRITICAL:** Release workflow broken - tests run before build
- **üéØ TARGET:** Reorder workflow steps to build before test
- **üìã SIMPLE FIX:** Move build step before test step in release.yml
- **‚úÖ VALIDATION:** Compare with working CI workflow pattern
---

## 5. Items (Context & Resources)
- **CI Release Regression Details:**
    - **Error Type:** Module not found - `dist/enigma.js`
    - **Root Cause:** Tests run before build in release workflow
    - **Impact:** 22 CLI tests failing, release workflow broken
    - **Solution:** Reorder workflow steps (build before test)
- **File Analysis:**
    - **package.json:** bin points to `"dist/enigma.js"` ‚úÖ
    - **ci.yml:** Has correct order (build ‚Üí test) ‚úÖ 
    - **release.yml:** Has wrong order (test ‚Üí build) ‚ùå
    - **build script:** `tsup` generates dist/ correctly ‚úÖ
- **Command Timeout Tracking:**
    - Recent operations: All within normal thresholds
    - No timeout issues detected
    - Environment: Stable development environment

## 6. Log (Action Log for Current Task)
- `[2025-01-21 23:35:00]` - `MISSION_ACCOMPLISHED` - `üéâ CI Release regression fix successfully completed!` - `‚úÖ VALIDATION: All 51 CLI tests now passing (21 + 30). Fixed .github/workflows/release.yml by moving build step before test step. Release workflow now mirrors working CI pattern and prevents module not found errors.`
- `[2025-01-21 23:30:00]` - `FIX_IMPLEMENTED` - `üîß Release workflow build order fixed!` - `‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION: Reordered .github/workflows/release.yml steps to run build before tests. CLI tests now pass because dist/enigma.js exists when needed.`
- `[2025-01-21 23:25:00]` - `ISSUE_IDENTIFIED` - `üö® CI Release regression identified!` - `‚ùå ANALYSIS: Release workflow runs tests before build, causing 22 CLI test failures. dist/enigma.js missing because build step runs after tests. Simple fix: reorder workflow steps.`

## 7. Backup Log (File Safety Tracking)
- **Backup Strategy:** GitHub workflow files are version controlled
- **Critical Files:** Only .github/workflows/release.yml requires modification
- **Rollback Plan:** Git version control provides immediate rollback capability

**Automatic Rules Applied by AI:**
- **RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01:** When ## 6. Log exceeds 5000 chars, summarize key points to ## 8. ArchiveLog and clear ## 6. Log
- **RULE_SUMMARY_01:** When `Status = COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`, add summary to project changelog
- **RULE_BACKUP_01:** Before major file modifications in CONSTRUCT, create backup entries in ## 7. Backup Log
- **RULE_CONTEXT_REFRESH_01:** After 3 consecutive failures on same issue, refresh context using Context7 with updated queries
- **üö® RULE_TIMEOUT_PROTECTION:** **MANDATORY**: Check timeout threshold, set is_background=false, monitor execution time, log timeouts in ## 5. Items
- **RULE_TIMEOUT_RECOVERY_01:** Command exceeds defined timeout threshold ‚Üí Terminate command immediately, log timeout error with classification, apply progressive retry strategy with conservative parameters
