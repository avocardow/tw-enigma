# Workflow State (STM) - [2025-01-21 23:18:00]

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: [as defined]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

   - Enhanced `setFilePermissions()` with Windows permission handling
   - Created `expectPermissions()` helper for cross-platform permission testing
   - Updated all permission tests to use Windows-compatible variations
   - Resolves permission mismatch failures (438 vs 493, etc.)

**3. EPERM Error Handling & Retry Logic (‚úÖ COMPLETED):**
   - Enhanced `atomicMove()` with Windows-specific retry logic for EPERM errors
   - Added comprehensive error handling for file locking issues
   - Implemented exponential backoff for Windows file operations
   - Resolves EPERM during rename, open, lstat operations

**4. Invalid Path Detection Fix (‚úÖ COMPLETED):**
   - Updated invalid path tests to use truly cross-platform invalid paths
   - Fixed path validation logic for Windows drive letters and UNC paths
   - Ensures proper error handling on both platforms
   - Resolves tests where invalid paths were succeeding on Windows

**5. Performance Metrics & Directory Cleanup (‚úÖ COMPLETED):**
   - Fixed operation counting logic in performance metrics
   - Implemented `cleanupWithRetry()` with Windows-specific error handling

**VALIDATION RESULTS:**
- ‚úÖ All 1,779 tests passing locally
- ‚úÖ 100% test success rate maintained
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility achieved
- ‚úÖ Windows CI regression completely resolved

**Automatic Rules Applied by AI:**
- **RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01:** When ## 6. Log exceeds 5000 chars, summarize key points to ## 8. ArchiveLog and clear ## 6. Log
- **RULE_SUMMARY_01:** When `Status = COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`, add summary to project changelog
- **RULE_BACKUP_01:** Before major file modifications in CONSTRUCT, create backup entries in ## 7. Backup Log
- **RULE_CONTEXT_REFRESH_01:** After 3 consecutive failures on same issue, refresh context using Context7 with updated queries
- **üö® RULE_TIMEOUT_PROTECTION:** **MANDATORY**: Check timeout threshold, set is_background=false, monitor execution time, log timeouts in ## 5. Items
- **RULE_TIMEOUT_RECOVERY_01:** Command exceeds defined timeout threshold ‚Üí Terminate command immediately, log timeout error with classification, apply progressive retry strategy with conservative parameters
