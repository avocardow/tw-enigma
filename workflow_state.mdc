# Workflow State (STM) - [2025-01-20 17:15:00]

## 🚨 CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: [as defined]

**⚠️ Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `VALIDATE`
- **Status:** `STEP1_COMPRESSION_COMPLETE`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** Task 17: "Develop backup mechanism for modified files"
- **Parsed Task Description:** Enhance existing FileIntegrityValidator system with advanced optimization features including compression, deduplication, and alternative backup strategies
- **Implementation Priority:** `medium`
- **Dependencies:** Task 16 ✅ (completed)
- **Complexity Assessment:** `high` - 4/5 complexity indicators met, but task is already well-broken down into subtasks
- **Updated Status:** 4 out of 12 subtasks already completed in Task 16 (backup creation, naming, cleanup, restore)
- **Remaining Work:** 8 pending subtasks for advanced optimization features
- **Validation Results:** ✅ Task is well-formed, dependencies satisfied, good subtask breakdown exists

## 3. Plan
*(Detailed step-by-step implementation plan created during BLUEPRINT phase)*

**Task 17 Implementation: Enhanced Backup System with Compression & Optimization**

**Foundation Assessment:**
- ✅ Task 16 already provides: backup creation, unique naming, cleanup, restore, comprehensive testing
- 🎯 Task 17 focus: Add compression, deduplication, incremental/differential strategies, large project optimization

**Step 1: Implement Compression for Backup Files (Subtask 7)** [ESTIMATED: 45min]
- Add compression configuration to config schema (enable/disable, compression level, algorithm selection)
- Extend FileIntegrityValidator with compression methods using Node.js zlib module
- Support gzip (default), deflate, and brotli compression algorithms
- Modify createBackup() to optionally compress backup files (.backup.gz extension)
- Update restoreFromBackup() to detect and decompress compressed backups automatically
- Use streaming compression via pipeline() for memory efficiency on large files
- Add error handling for compression/decompression failures
- Write 8-10 unit tests covering compression scenarios and edge cases

**Step 2: File Deduplication Strategy Implementation (Subtask 8)** [ESTIMATED: 60min]
- Design content-based deduplication using file content hashes
- Create deduplication storage structure in backup directory (.enigma/dedup/)
- Implement hash-based content store with reference counting
- Modify backup creation to check for existing content via SHA-256 hash
- Store deduplicated content with hash-based filenames
- Update restore process to reconstruct files from deduplicated storage
- Add deduplication metrics tracking (storage saved, reference counts)
- Write 10-12 tests for deduplication logic and edge cases

**Step 3: Incremental Backup Strategy (Subtask 9)** [ESTIMATED: 45min]  
- Design incremental backup metadata structure (track last backup timestamp)
- Implement file change detection using modification time and checksums
- Add incremental backup creation that only backs up changed files
- Create incremental backup manifest files linking to full backup
- Update restore process to reconstruct from incremental chain
- Add configuration options for incremental vs full backup strategy
- Write 8-10 tests for incremental backup scenarios

**Step 4: Differential Backup Strategy (Subtask 10)** [ESTIMATED: 45min]
- Implement differential backup tracking against last full backup
- Store all changes since last full backup in differential manifest
- Add differential backup creation and restoration logic
- Provide configuration to choose between incremental, differential, or full backups
- Write 8-10 tests for differential backup scenarios

**Step 5: Large Project Optimization (Subtask 11)** [ESTIMATED: 30min]
- Implement batched file processing to limit memory usage
- Add progress reporting for long-running backup operations via logging system
- Optimize file traversal using existing glob-based file discovery
- Add performance metrics collection (files processed, time taken, storage used)
- Create performance tests with simulated large project structures

**Step 6: Integration Testing (Subtask 12)** [ESTIMATED: 30min]
- Test new features with existing FileIntegrityValidator system
- Verify backward compatibility with Task 16 backup format
- Ensure CLI options work with new compression and backup strategies
- Add integration tests for combined features (compressed incremental backups, etc.)
- Update documentation and CLI help text

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Use Node.js zlib module: createGzip(), createDeflate(), createBrotliCompress() 
- Stream processing with pipeline() for memory efficiency
- Extend existing Zod configuration schema for new options
- Build on existing error handling and logging infrastructure
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing backup files
- Add new CLI flags: --compression, --strategy (full/incremental/differential), --deduplicate

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for each new feature (40-50 new tests estimated)
- Integration tests with existing backup system
- Performance tests with large file sets
- Backward compatibility tests with Task 16 backups
- Cross-platform testing for compression/decompression

**Rollback Plan:**
- Backup current FileIntegrityValidator implementation
- Feature flags to disable new functionality if issues arise
- Fallback to Task 16 backup behavior if compression fails

## 4. Rules for Current Phase

---
**Phase: `TASK_VALIDATION` (NEW)**
- **🚨 TIMEOUT PROTECTION:** Commands have defined timeouts per type! Monitor strictly. Set is_background=false.
- **Action:**
    1. Validate task is well-formed and understandable ✅
    2. Check if dependencies exist and are accessible ✅ (Task 16 completed)
    3. Assess task complexity using complexity indicators
    4. Determine if task needs breakdown before planning
- **Complexity Indicators (Auto-escalate to breakdown):**
    - Modifying >5 files
    - >2 hours estimated work  
    - Affects >3 other components
    - Requires >10 new tests
    - Involves new API integrations
- **Rules:**
    - If task unclear: Set `Status = AWAITING_CLARIFICATION`
    - If dependencies missing: Document and escalate
    - If complexity high: Use `task-master expand --id=<id>` or break down manually
    - If valid and manageable: Set `Phase = BLUEPRINT`
- **Next:** Transition based on validation results.
