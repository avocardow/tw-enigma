# Workflow State (STM) - [2025-01-21 09:35:00]

## 🚨 CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: [as defined]

**⚠️ Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Continue fixing failing tests to achieve 100% test success rate (26 failures remaining from 1779 tests - 98.54% pass rate)

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `CONSTRUCT`
- **Status:** `IN_PROGRESS_FIXING_TESTS`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** Test Fixes - Systematic Resolution of Failing Tests (OUTSTANDING PROGRESS!)
- **Parsed Task Description:** User requested to run all tests and fix any failing tests to achieve 100% success rate
- **Implementation Priority:** `high`
- **Dependencies:** None - standalone fix task
- **Complexity Assessment:** `high` - Multiple modules with different failure types
- **Current Test Status:** 9 failing tests remaining (MAJOR IMPROVEMENT from 31!)

## 3. Plan
**OUTSTANDING PROGRESS ACHIEVED! 🎉**
✅ **Import Extension Fixes:** All TypeScript compatibility issues resolved
✅ **Module Resolution:** CLI and all modules now working correctly
✅ **Major Modules Completed:** CLI (100%), AtomicPermissionManager (100%), AtomicOperationsSystem (100%)
✅ **AtomicFileCreator Fixed:** Test isolation issue resolved with unique directory approach
✅ **Progress:** Reduced failures from 31→9 (71% improvement, 99.49% pass rate!)

**REMAINING FAILURES ANALYSIS (9 tests):**

**HIGH PRIORITY - Tailwind Integration (2 failures):**
- Missing pattern files graceful handling (1 failure)
- Autocomplete pattern suggestions (1 failure)

**HIGH PRIORITY - Asset Hasher (1 failure):**
- Manifest generation compression calculations (1 failure)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - CSS Optimization CLI (1 failure):**
- CLI command execution error handling (1 failure)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY - Production Config Manager (5 failures):**
- Environment-specific defaults (1 failure)
- Configuration conflict detection (1 failure)
- Error handling and recovery (1 failure)
- Suggestion system (1 failure)
- Configuration serialization (1 failure)

**NEXT EXECUTION PLAN:**
- **Step 1:** Fix Production Config Manager (biggest remaining category - 5 failures)
- **Step 2:** Fix Tailwind Integration (2 failures)
- **Step 3:** Fix Asset Hasher manifest generation
- **Step 4:** Fix CSS Optimization CLI error handling

## 4. Rules for Current Phase

---
**Phase: `FETCHING_TASK`**
- **🚨 TIMEOUT PROTECTION:** Task-Master commands have 30s timeout! Monitor execution time.
- **Action:** Execute `task-master next` to get the next available task, or use project-specific task commands if Task-Master is not available.
- **Rules:**
    - If no more tasks: Set `Phase = ALL_TASKS_DONE`
    - Else: Populate task details in `workflow_state.mdc` (## Items) and set `Phase = TASK_VALIDATION`
- **Next:** Transition based on task availability

Identified quick wins: CLI module resolution, AtomicPermissionManager API, ProductionCssConfigManager validation.`
- `[2025-01-21 09:30:00]` - `ANALYSIS` - `AtomicFileCreator test isolation issue identified` - `The failing test "should stop on first error when stopOnError is true" passes when run alone but fails when run with all tests (test isolation issue). This is a common pattern where tests have subtle dependencies on execution order or shared state. Since this represents only 1 test out of 1779 (0.06%), marking as known issue and proceeding with other failure categories that have higher impact.`
