# Workflow State (STM) - 2025-01-20 15:30:00

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: CSS processing: 120s, File analysis: 90s

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `COMMITTING`
- **Status:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** Task ID: 1 - "Set up project repository and basic structure" - Retrieved from Task-Master MCP
- **Parsed Task Description:** Initialize the project repository with necessary files and folder structure for Tailwind Enigma Core, including repository setup, npm configuration, folder structure, code quality tools, and documentation.
- **Implementation Priority:** `high`
- **Dependencies:** [] (No dependencies)
- **Complexity Assessment:** **Simple** - Most work already completed. Analysis shows: Repository already exists, package.json configured with proper scripts and dependencies, folder structure established (src/, tests/, bin/, scripts/), ESLint and Prettier configured, comprehensive README.md exists. Only missing items are verification of git remote and ensuring all subtasks are properly completed.
- **Estimated Files to Modify:** 0-2 files (mostly verification and potential minor updates)
- **Checkpoint Markers:** None required - all changes are low-risk verification and documentation tasks

## 3. Plan
*(Detailed step-by-step implementation plan created during BLUEPRINT phase)*

**Context:** Most of the task requirements have already been completed in the current project state. The implementation plan focuses on verification and ensuring all subtasks are properly addressed.

- **Step 1:** Verify Git repository status and remote configuration
  - Check git remote origin is properly configured
  - Verify repository is connected to GitHub
  - Confirm branch structure and protection if applicable
  
- **Step 2:** Validate package.json configuration against requirements
  - Confirm project metadata matches expected values for Tailwind Enigma Core
  - Verify all required scripts are present (test, lint, build, etc.)
  - Check dependencies align with project requirements
  
- **Step 3:** Verify folder structure completeness
  - Confirm src/, tests/, bin/, scripts/ directories exist with appropriate content
  - Check for any missing placeholder files or README files in subdirectories
  - Validate directory structure matches project conventions
  
- **Step 4:** Validate code quality tool configuration
  - Test ESLint configuration works properly
  - Verify Prettier configuration and formatting
  - Check TypeScript configuration if applicable
  - Test linting and formatting scripts
  
- **Step 5:** Review and update documentation as needed
  - Verify README.md contains all required sections
  - Check if any documentation needs updates for Tailwind Enigma Core specifics
  - Ensure CONTRIBUTING.md and other supporting docs exist if needed
  
- **Step 6:** Run validation tests to confirm project setup
  - Test npm/pnpm scripts work correctly
  - Verify build process functions
  - Check that linting and formatting commands execute successfully
  
**Testing Strategy:** 
- Manual verification of repository structure and configuration
- Execute npm/pnpm scripts to verify functionality
- Run linting and formatting to confirm code quality tools work
- Test build process to ensure project compiles correctly

**Rollback Plan:** 
- No significant changes planned, minimal rollback risk
- Git status can be reverted if any configuration changes are made
- Package.json changes can be reverted from git history if needed

**Plan ready for approval. Please review ## 3. Plan and confirm to proceed.**

## 4. Rules for Current Phase

**Phase: `INITIALIZING`**
- **Action:** 
    1. Read and thoroughly understand `project_config.mdc` (or available project documentation) ‚úÖ
    2. Initialize workflow state structure ‚úÖ
    3. Verify all necessary tools and access are available
- **Next Step:** Set `Phase = FETCHING_TASK` and update this file.
