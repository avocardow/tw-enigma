# Workflow State (STM) - [2025-01-20 17:20:00]

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: [as defined]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION`
- **Status:** `SUBTASK_COMPLETED`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** Task 17: "Develop backup mechanism for modified files"
- **Current Subtask:** 17.12 "Integration Testing with Existing System" ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Parsed Task Description:** Comprehensive integration testing across all backup optimization features completed successfully
- **Implementation Priority:** `medium`
- **Dependencies:** Subtasks 17.7 ‚úÖ, 17.8 ‚úÖ, 17.9 ‚úÖ, 17.10 ‚úÖ, 17.11 ‚úÖ, 17.12 ‚úÖ (all completed)
- **Complexity Assessment:** `complex` - Integration testing across multiple systems completed
- **Estimated Files to Modify:** 1 file (comprehensive integration tests implemented)
- **Final Test Results:** 11/11 integration tests passing (100% success rate)

## 3. Plan
**Integration Testing Implementation Plan for Subtask 17.12:**

**Step 1: Integration Test Suite Development**
- Create comprehensive integration tests in `tests/fileIntegrity.integration.test.ts`
- Test all feature combinations: compression + deduplication, compression + incremental, etc.
- Validate multi-feature workflows: compress ‚Üí deduplicate ‚Üí incremental backup chain
- Test large project optimization with all other features enabled
- Verify CLI integration works correctly with all new configuration options

**Step 2: Backward Compatibility Validation**
- Test that existing backup files can still be restored after feature additions
- Validate that configuration migration works for users upgrading
- Ensure default settings maintain existing behavior for current users
- Test edge cases with mixed backup types (old + new format combinations)

**Step 3: Cross-Feature Integration Testing**
- **Compression + Deduplication**: Verify compressed files are properly deduplicated
- **Incremental + Compression**: Test compressed incremental backup chains
- **Differential + Deduplication**: Validate differential backups with content deduplication
- **Large Project + All Features**: Test batched processing with compression, deduplication, and backup strategies
- **Error Handling**: Test failure scenarios across feature combinations

**Step 4: CLI and Configuration System Validation**
- Verify all new CLI options work correctly and don't conflict
- Test configuration file loading with all new options
- Validate argument parsing and normalization for complex configurations
- Test help documentation reflects all new features accurately

**Step 5: Performance Integration Testing**
- Benchmark performance with various feature combinations
- Validate that multiple optimizations don't negatively interact
- Test memory usage patterns with all features enabled on large projects
- Measure space savings with optimal feature combinations

**Validation Criteria:**
- All integration tests pass (aim for >95% success rate)
- Backward compatibility maintained (existing backups still work)
- CLI help and configuration documentation accurate
- Performance benchmarks show expected optimization benefits
- No feature conflicts or unexpected interactions

**Rollback Plan:**
- Previous working state available via git commit history
- Feature flags allow disabling problematic combinations
- Backup directory structure maintains compatibility

## 4. Rules for Current Phase

---
**Phase: `COMPLETED_ITERATION` (Enhanced Completion)**
- **üö® TIMEOUT PROTECTION:** Task-Master commands have 30s timeout! Monitor strictly. Set is_background=false.
- **Action:**
    1. **‚ö†Ô∏è TIMEOUT-AWARE:** Mark task complete using `task-master set-status --id=<taskId> --status=done` or equivalent
    2. Clear task-specific data for next iteration
    3. Archive current action log if needed (RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01)
    4. Update progress tracking and metrics
    5. Clean up temporary files and backup states
- **Log:** "Task [Task ID] completed successfully and pushed."
- **Next Step:** Set `Phase = FETCHING_TASK` to continue with next task
