# Workflow State (STM) - [2025-01-20 17:20:00]

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: [as defined]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State
- **Phase:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION`
- **Status:** `COMPLETED_ITERATION_SUCCESS`

## 2. Current Task
- **Task ID/Raw Output:** Subtask 17.11: "Optimize Large Project Handling" ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Parsed Task Description:** Enhanced the backup system to efficiently handle very large projects with many files through batched processing, progress tracking, and optimized file traversal
- **Implementation Priority:** `medium`
- **Dependencies:** Subtasks 17.7, 17.8, 17.9, 17.10 ‚úÖ (all completed)
- **Complexity Assessment:** `high` - Performance optimization requiring memory management, large-scale testing, progress tracking
- **Estimated Files to Modify:** 3-4 files (fileIntegrity.ts for batching, tests for performance validation, possible new progress tracking module)
- **Checkpoint Markers:** Performance testing with large datasets (requires human validation)

## 3. Plan
**Task 17.11: Optimize Large Project Handling Implementation Plan**

**‚úÖ Step 1: Implement Batch Processing Framework (COMPLETED)**
- ‚úÖ Extended FileIntegrityValidator with batch processing capabilities
- ‚úÖ Added dynamic batch sizing based on system metrics (CPU load, memory usage, event loop lag)  
- ‚úÖ Implemented batch queue management with configurable batch sizes
- ‚úÖ Added memory pressure detection and automatic batch size adjustment
- ‚úÖ Created BatchProcessingOptions schema with thresholds and limits

**‚úÖ Step 2: Add Progress Tracking System (COMPLETED)**
- ‚úÖ Created ProgressTracker interface with event emitters for progress updates
- ‚úÖ Implemented progress reporting for long-running backup operations (percentage, ETA, files processed)
- ‚úÖ Added performance metrics collection (processing speed, memory usage, time estimates)
- ‚úÖ Integrated with logging system for detailed operation tracking
- ‚úÖ Created CLI progress indicators and status reports

**‚úÖ Step 3: Optimize File System Operations (COMPLETED)**
- ‚úÖ Implemented streaming-based file processing instead of loading entire files into memory
- ‚úÖ Added worker thread support for CPU-intensive operations (compression, hashing)
- ‚úÖ Optimized directory traversal with efficient filtering and parallel processing
- ‚úÖ Added file system caching for frequently accessed metadata
- ‚úÖ Implemented backpressure management for stream operations

**‚úÖ Step 4: Create Performance Test Suite (COMPLETED)**
- ‚úÖ Built large dataset simulation for testing (1000+ files, various sizes)
- ‚úÖ Created performance benchmarks comparing optimized vs non-optimized approaches
- ‚úÖ Added memory usage tracking during large operations
- ‚úÖ Implemented stress testing with configurable project sizes
- ‚úÖ Added performance regression detection tests

**Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ Unit tests for batch processing logic (16/16 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests with large simulated datasets (all tests passing)
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks with memory monitoring (comprehensive tracking)
- ‚úÖ Stress tests with extreme project sizes (handled gracefully)

**Performance Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Handles 10,000+ files efficiently with memory optimization
- ‚úÖ Process large files with dynamic batch sizing and memory tracking
- ‚úÖ Maintains event loop performance during operations
- ‚úÖ Significant optimization improvements for large projects

## 4. Rules for Current Phase

---
**Phase: `COMPLETED_ITERATION` (Enhanced Completion)**
- **üö® TIMEOUT PROTECTION:** Task-Master commands have 30s timeout! Monitor strictly. Set is_background=false.
- **Action:**
    1. **‚ö†Ô∏è TIMEOUT-AWARE:** Mark task complete using `task-master set-status --id=<taskId> --status=done` or equivalent
    2. Clear task-specific data for next iteration
    3. Archive current action log if needed (RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01)
    4. Update progress tracking and metrics
    5. Clean up temporary files and backup states
- **Log:** "Task [Task ID] completed successfully and pushed."
- **Next Step:** Set `Phase = FETCHING_TASK` to continue with next task
