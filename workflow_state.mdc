# Workflow State (STM) - [2025-01-20 16:50:00]

## üö® CRITICAL COMMAND TIMEOUT REMINDERS
**BEFORE EVERY COMMAND EXECUTION:**
1. **CHECK TIMEOUT THRESHOLD** from section 8a of project_config.mdc for command type
2. **SET is_background=false** for all commands (unless specifically background processes)
3. **MONITOR execution time** and be prepared to terminate hanging commands
4. **ESCALATE after 2 consecutive timeouts** of same command type to human
5. **LOG all timeout incidents** in ## 5. Items > Command Timeout Tracking

**Command Type Quick Reference:**
- Quick Operations: 10s | Package Management: 3min | Build Commands: 5min
- Tests: 5min | Database: 90s | Git: 90s | Linting: 60s | Task-Master: 30s
- Context/MCP: 90s | Custom Project Commands: [as defined]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Commands that commonly hang:** package installs, tests, git push, database operations, builds, type checking

## 0. Current Overall Goal
- Autonomously process tasks using available task management systems (preferably Task-Master), implement solutions following project standards, validate implementation, and commit changes.

## 1. State

## 4. Rules for Current Phase

---
**Phase: `COMPLETED_ITERATION` (Enhanced Completion)**
- **üö® TIMEOUT PROTECTION:** Task-Master commands have 30s timeout! Monitor strictly. Set is_background=false.
- **Action:**
    1. **‚ö†Ô∏è TIMEOUT-AWARE:** Mark task complete using `task-master set-status --id=<taskId> --status=done` or equivalent
    2. Clear task-specific data for next iteration
    3. Archive current action log if needed (RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01)
    4. Update progress tracking and metrics
    5. Clean up temporary files and backup states
- **Log:** "Task [Task ID] completed successfully and pushed."
- **Next Step:** Set `Phase = FETCHING_TASK` to continue with next task
