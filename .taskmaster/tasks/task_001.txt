# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Monorepo Foundation Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the basic monorepo directory structure, configure pnpm workspaces, and establish the root package.json with shared dependencies.
# Details:
1. Initialize the monorepo root directory
2. Create the following structure:
```
./
├── packages/
│   ├── core/
│   └── cli/
├── package.json
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
├── turbo.json
├── tsconfig.base.json
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```
3. Configure root package.json:
```json
{
  "name": "tw-enigma-monorepo",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo build",
    "test": "turbo test",
    "lint": "turbo lint",
    "dev": "turbo dev"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "^2.0.4",
    "typescript": "^5.2.2",
    "eslint": "^8.53.0",
    "prettier": "^3.0.3"
  }
}
```
4. Configure pnpm-workspace.yaml:
```yaml
packages:
  - 'packages/*'
```
5. Install pnpm globally if not already installed: `npm install -g pnpm@latest` (at least v7.0.0)
6. Run `pnpm install` to initialize the workspace

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify directory structure is created correctly
2. Validate pnpm-workspace.yaml configuration
3. Ensure pnpm install completes successfully
4. Confirm workspace recognition with `pnpm -r exec pwd`
5. Validate that the root package.json contains all required scripts and dependencies

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize the Monorepo Repository [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Git repository and initialize it with version control. Ensure Node.js and pnpm are installed.
### Details:
Run 'git init' in the desired directory. Confirm Node.js (v16.13+) and pnpm are installed as prerequisites.

## 2. Create the Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Establish the foundational directory layout for the monorepo, including folders for apps, packages, and shared code.
### Details:
Create directories such as 'apps/', 'packages/', and any other relevant folders to organize projects and shared modules.

## 3. Configure pnpm Workspaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up pnpm workspaces to manage multiple packages within the monorepo efficiently.
### Details:
Create a 'pnpm-workspace.yaml' file at the root, specifying workspace patterns (e.g., 'apps/*', 'packages/*') to include all relevant subprojects.

## 4. Set Up Root Configuration Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Add and configure essential root-level files: package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, turbo.json, and tsconfig.base.json.
### Details:
Initialize a root 'package.json' with workspace settings, add 'turbo.json' for task orchestration, and create 'tsconfig.base.json' for shared TypeScript configuration. Ensure all files are properly structured for monorepo tooling.

## 5. Verify Initial Workspace Installation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Install dependencies and verify that the workspace is correctly set up and all packages are recognized.
### Details:
Run 'pnpm install' at the root. Confirm that dependencies are installed, workspace packages are linked, and tooling (e.g., TurboRepo, TypeScript) recognizes all configured projects.
