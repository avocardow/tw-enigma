# Task ID: 27
# Title: Develop plugin system for extensibility
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a plugin system to allow users to extend the tool's functionality.
# Details:
1. Create src/pluginSystem.js
2. Define plugin API and lifecycle hooks
3. Implement plugin loading and execution
4. Add plugin configuration in enigma.config.js
5. Create documentation for plugin development
6. Implement error handling for plugin failures

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mock plugins and various execution scenarios

# Subtasks:
## 1. Project Setup and Initial Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational project structure, select the programming language and frameworks, and define the core architectural patterns for the plugin system.
### Details:
Create a new repository, set up version control, initialize the project with build tools, and document the initial architecture. Define directory structure for core, plugins, configs, and documentation.

## 2. API Definition and Specification [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Design and document the APIs that plugins will use to interact with the host system, including lifecycle hooks, data exchange formats, and extension points.
### Details:
Draft API interfaces, specify required and optional methods, define data contracts (e.g., JSON schemas), and create example plugin stubs. Review with stakeholders and iterate as needed.

## 3. Plugin Loader Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.2
### Description: Develop the dynamic plugin discovery and loading mechanism, supporting runtime addition and removal of plugins.
### Details:
Implement scanning of plugin directories, validation of plugin manifests, dynamic import/loading logic, and unloading/cleanup routines. Write unit tests for loader edge cases.

## 4. Plugin Execution and Isolation [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.3
### Description: Implement the execution environment for plugins, ensuring proper isolation, resource management, and controlled invocation of plugin APIs.
### Details:
Design sandboxing or process isolation as needed, manage plugin lifecycle (init, run, shutdown), and enforce API boundaries. Add tests for concurrent and faulty plugin execution.

## 5. Configuration Management Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.4
### Description: Integrate a configuration system that allows both core and plugins to define, read, and update settings, supporting overrides and validation.
### Details:
Design config schema, implement config loader/merger, expose config APIs to plugins, and add validation/error reporting for misconfigurations. Provide sample config files.

## 6. Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.5
### Description: Establish robust error handling strategies for all plugin system components, including plugin failures, loader errors, and API misuse, with detailed logging.
### Details:
Implement try/catch wrappers, error propagation, and recovery mechanisms. Integrate structured logging for all plugin operations and failures. Write tests for error scenarios.

## 7. Documentation and Developer Guide Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Produce thorough documentation covering API usage, plugin development, configuration, error handling, and system architecture for both users and developers.
### Details:
Write API reference, plugin authoring guide, configuration manual, and troubleshooting section. Include code samples, diagrams, and FAQ. Validate documentation with sample plugin projects.
