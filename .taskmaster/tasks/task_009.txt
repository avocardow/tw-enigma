# Task ID: 9
# Title: Migrate and Configure Test Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate the existing 1,779 tests to the appropriate packages and configure the test infrastructure for the monorepo.
# Details:
1. Create vitest.config.ts files for each package:
```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'node',
    include: ['tests/**/*.test.ts'],
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
    },
  },
});
```
2. Categorize existing tests by functionality (core vs. CLI)
3. Migrate core-related tests to packages/core/tests/
4. Migrate CLI-related tests to packages/cli/tests/
5. Update test imports to use the new package structure
6. Create shared test utilities in each package if needed
7. Add test scripts to each package's package.json:
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest run",
  "test:watch": "vitest",
  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
}
```
8. Add a test script to the root package.json for running all tests:
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "turbo test",
  "test:coverage": "turbo test:coverage"
}
```
9. Configure test fixtures and shared test data
10. Update any test environment variables or configuration
11. Ensure all test dependencies are properly installed

# Test Strategy:
1. Run tests for each package individually to verify migration
2. Run all tests from the root to verify monorepo test configuration
3. Check test coverage reports for each package
4. Verify that all 1,779 tests are accounted for and passing
5. Test the watch mode functionality
6. Validate that tests correctly use dependencies between packages
7. Ensure test fixtures are properly loaded in the new structure

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Test Configuration Files [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and standardize test configuration files for all relevant packages to ensure consistent test execution environments.

## 2. Categorize Existing Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Review and categorize all existing tests (1,779) by type, package, and priority to facilitate organized migration.
### Details:
Establish categories such as unit, integration, and end-to-end; tag tests accordingly.

## 3. Migrate Tests to Target Packages [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Move categorized tests to their appropriate target packages, ensuring directory structure and naming conventions are followed.
### Details:
Track progress and verify that all tests are accounted for in the migration.

## 4. Update Test Imports and References [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Update all import statements and internal references in migrated tests to reflect new package locations and shared utilities.
### Details:
Automate refactoring where possible and manually review complex cases.

## 5. Set Up Shared Test Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Develop or migrate shared test utility modules to a central location accessible by all packages.
### Details:
Document utility usage and update test imports to use shared utilities.

## 6. Configure Test Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.5
### Description: Update or create test runner scripts (e.g., npm scripts, CI/CD jobs) to execute tests in their new locations.
### Details:
Ensure scripts support parallel execution and reporting.

## 7. Migrate and Refactor Test Fixtures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Move and refactor test fixtures to align with new test locations and shared utility patterns.
### Details:
Ensure fixtures are reusable and compatible with updated test imports.

## 8. Update Environment and Global Configurations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Adjust environment variables, global config files, and setup scripts to support the new test structure.
### Details:
Verify that all packages can access required environment settings for tests.

## 9. Install and Update Test Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review, install, and update all necessary test dependencies in each package to ensure compatibility and avoid duplication.
### Details:
Remove obsolete dependencies and document required versions.

## 10. Validate Test Coverage and Pass Rates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run all migrated tests, analyze coverage reports, and compare pass rates to pre-migration baselines to ensure migration integrity.
### Details:
Identify and resolve any regressions or missing tests; document results and sign off on migration.
