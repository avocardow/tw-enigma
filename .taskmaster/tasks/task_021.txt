# Task ID: 21
# Title: Develop success reporting and statistics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 15
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a system to generate and display optimization statistics and success metrics.
# Details:
1. Create src/reporter.js
2. Implement functions to calculate size reductions
3. Generate statistics on patterns optimized
4. Create visual output (e.g., tables, charts) using cli-table3@0.6.3
5. Implement optional detailed report generation
6. Add performance metrics (execution time, memory usage)

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for statistics calculation and output formatting

# Subtasks:
## 1. Reporter Creation Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundation for the reporting system by defining requirements and designing the reporter framework
### Details:
Define reporter interfaces, establish data models, create configuration options, and set up the basic reporter structure. Include authentication mechanisms and access control settings. Design should accommodate all planned report types and ensure extensibility for future additions.

## 2. Size Calculation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Develop modules to accurately calculate and track size metrics across different dimensions
### Details:
Create algorithms for size measurement, implement data collection mechanisms, develop storage solutions for historical size data, and build aggregation functions. Include options for different measurement units and ensure calculations handle edge cases like empty datasets or corrupted values.

## 3. Statistics Generation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2
### Description: Build the core statistics processing engine to analyze collected data and generate meaningful insights
### Details:
Implement statistical algorithms (mean, median, variance, etc.), create trend analysis functions, develop anomaly detection capabilities, and build data normalization processes. Include caching mechanisms for performance optimization and ensure statistical validity through proper sampling techniques.

## 4. Visual Output Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Create visualization components to present data in intuitive and interactive formats
### Details:
Develop chart and graph components, implement dashboard layouts, create interactive visualization elements, and build export capabilities for different formats. Include accessibility features and ensure responsive design for different screen sizes and devices.

## 5. Detailed Reports Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.3, 21.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive reporting templates and generation mechanisms for in-depth analysis
### Details:
Create report templates, implement scheduling mechanisms, develop filtering and sorting capabilities, and build export functionality for various formats (PDF, Excel, CSV). Include customization options for report layouts and ensure proper handling of large datasets through pagination or chunking.

## 6. Performance Metrics Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.5
### Description: Implement system performance tracking and reporting to monitor efficiency and identify optimization opportunities
### Details:
Develop performance monitoring hooks, create benchmarking tools, implement resource usage tracking, and build alerting mechanisms for performance thresholds. Include historical performance comparison capabilities and ensure minimal impact on system performance while collecting metrics.
