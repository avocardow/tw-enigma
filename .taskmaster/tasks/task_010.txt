# Task ID: 10
# Title: Configure CI/CD for Monorepo
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and delivery that are monorepo-aware.
# Details:
1. Create .github/workflows/ci.yml for continuous integration:
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 7
      - name: Get pnpm store directory
        id: pnpm-cache
        run: echo "STORE_PATH=$(pnpm store path)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      - uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: ${{ steps.pnpm-cache.outputs.STORE_PATH }}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-${{ hashFiles('**/pnpm-lock.yaml') }}
          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-pnpm-
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install
      - name: Build
        run: pnpm build
      - name: Test
        run: pnpm test
      - name: Lint
        run: pnpm lint
```
2. Configure Turborepo remote caching for CI (optional):
```yaml
- name: Setup Turborepo cache
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: .turbo
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-turbo-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-turbo-
```
3. Create a release workflow in .github/workflows/release.yml:
```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 7
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install
      - name: Build
        run: pnpm build
      - name: Test
        run: pnpm test
      - name: Publish
        run: pnpm publish -r --no-git-checks
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
```
4. Create a changeset configuration for versioning (optional):
```json
// .changeset/config.json
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@changesets/config@2.3.1/schema.json",
  "changelog": "@changesets/cli/changelog",
  "commit": false,
  "fixed": [],
  "linked": [],
  "access": "public",
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "updateInternalDependencies": "patch",
  "ignore": []
}
```
5. Add GitHub Actions badge to README.md
6. Configure branch protection rules in GitHub repository settings

# Test Strategy:
1. Test the CI workflow by creating a test pull request
2. Verify that all jobs in the workflow complete successfully
3. Test the caching mechanism by making a small change and checking build times
4. Validate that the workflow correctly identifies and builds only changed packages
5. Test the release workflow with a test tag (if possible)
6. Verify that branch protection rules work as expected
7. Check that CI properly reports test and build failures

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create CI Workflows for Monorepo Projects [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement continuous integration workflows for each project or application within the monorepo, ensuring that builds and tests are triggered only for relevant changes.
### Details:
Set up separate build and test jobs for each project, using directory-based triggers to avoid unnecessary job executions and improve pipeline efficiency.

## 2. Configure Caching for Dependencies and Builds [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement caching strategies in the CI workflows to speed up dependency installation and build steps across all projects in the monorepo.
### Details:
Utilize CI/CD platform caching mechanisms to store and restore dependencies and build artifacts, reducing redundant work and improving pipeline performance.

## 3. Set Up Automated Release Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Establish workflows to automate the release process for each project, including tagging, changelog generation, and artifact publishing.
### Details:
Configure release jobs that are triggered by specific events (e.g., merges to main branch or version bumps), ensuring each project can be released independently.

## 4. Integrate Changeset and Versioning Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Add and configure tools for managing changesets and automated versioning across all projects in the monorepo.
### Details:
Set up tools like Changesets or semantic-release to track changes, generate changelogs, and increment versions as part of the release workflow.

## 5. Update and Maintain Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Document the CI/CD setup, workflow structure, caching strategies, release process, and versioning approach for contributors.
### Details:
Ensure clear and up-to-date documentation is available in the repository, covering how to use and maintain the CI/CD system.

## 6. Configure Branch Protection and Permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5
### Description: Set up branch protection rules and permissions to enforce code quality, review requirements, and deployment restrictions.
### Details:
Implement policies such as required status checks, code reviews, and deployment permissions to maintain repository integrity and security.

## 7. Validate and Test the Full CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6
### Description: Run end-to-end tests of the entire CI/CD pipeline to ensure all workflows, caching, releases, versioning, and protections function as intended.
### Details:
Perform test runs simulating typical development and release scenarios, verifying that only relevant jobs are triggered and all automation works correctly.
