# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement pretty name generation algorithm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an algorithm to generate aesthetic identifiers without character repetition.
# Details:
1. Extend src/nameGeneration.js
2. Implement permutation-based algorithm
3. Ensure no character repetition in generated names
4. Handle cases where permutations are exhausted
5. Optimize for performance with large pattern sets
6. Implement caching for generated names

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for various pattern counts and aesthetic criteria

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Project Environment and Baseline Name Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the codebase, configure version control, and implement a basic name generator that produces names from a static list or simple algorithm.
### Details:
Includes setting up the repository, installing dependencies, and writing a minimal generator function to serve as the foundation for further extensions.

## 2. Design and Implement Permutation Logic for Name Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop logic to generate unique name permutations, ensuring aesthetic quality and non-repetitiveness.
### Details:
Define permutation rules, implement algorithms to combine name components, and ensure output diversity. Document edge cases and handle invalid permutations.

## 3. Implement Exhaustion Handling Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Detect when all possible name permutations have been generated and handle exhaustion gracefully.
### Details:
Add logic to track generated names, return appropriate errors or fallback strategies when exhausted, and log exhaustion events for monitoring.

## 4. Optimize Name Generation Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Profile the permutation logic and optimize for speed and memory usage, especially for large input sets.
### Details:
Identify bottlenecks, refactor code for efficiency, and benchmark improvements. Consider lazy evaluation or streaming approaches if needed.

## 5. Implement Caching for Generated Names [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Design and integrate a caching layer to store and quickly retrieve previously generated names, reducing redundant computation.
### Details:
Choose an appropriate caching strategy (in-memory, persistent), implement cache invalidation policies, and ensure thread safety if applicable.

## 6. Develop Comprehensive Unit and Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Write tests covering all logic, including permutation generation, exhaustion handling, performance optimizations, and caching.
### Details:
Ensure tests cover edge cases, concurrency, and regression scenarios. Use automated testing frameworks and set up continuous integration.

## 7. Validate and Document the Extended Name Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform end-to-end validation, document usage, configuration, and known limitations. Prepare release notes and user guides.
### Details:
Conduct manual and automated validation, gather feedback, and update documentation to reflect all new features and changes.
