# Task ID: 35
# Title: Set up continuous integration and deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
# Details:
1. Set up GitHub Actions for CI
2. Configure automated testing on pull requests
3. Implement automated npm publishing
4. Set up code coverage reporting
5. Configure automated dependency updates
6. Implement release note generation

# Test Strategy:
Validation of CI/CD pipeline with test projects and mock releases

# Subtasks:
## 1. CI Environment Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational CI environment by selecting and configuring the CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins). Ensure runners/agents are available and integrate with the project repository.
### Details:
Install and configure the chosen CI/CD tool. Set up runners or agents as required. Connect the project repository and verify webhook triggers for code pushes and pull requests.

## 2. Automated Test Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Implement automated test execution within the CI pipeline, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
### Details:
Define test scripts and ensure all test dependencies are installed. Configure pipeline steps to run tests on each commit or pull request. Fail the pipeline on test failures and generate test reports.

## 3. NPM Publishing Automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2
### Description: Automate the process of publishing packages to the npm registry as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
### Details:
Set up npm authentication using secure tokens. Add pipeline steps to build and publish the package on successful test completion, ensuring versioning and tagging are handled according to semantic release practices.

## 4. Coverage Reporting Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2
### Description: Integrate code coverage tools to collect and report test coverage metrics within the CI pipeline.
### Details:
Install and configure a coverage tool (e.g., Istanbul, nyc, Coveralls). Add steps to generate coverage reports and upload them to a coverage service or as pipeline artifacts. Enforce minimum coverage thresholds if required.

## 5. Automated Dependency Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Implement automated workflows to check for and update project dependencies regularly.
### Details:
Configure tools like Dependabot or Renovate to scan for outdated dependencies. Set up scheduled jobs to create pull requests for dependency updates and ensure these are tested by the CI pipeline.

## 6. Automated Release Notes Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.3
### Description: Automate the generation of release notes based on commit history, pull requests, and issue tracking.
### Details:
Integrate tools (e.g., conventional-changelog, release-please) to parse commit messages and generate structured release notes. Add steps to publish release notes to the repository or documentation site as part of the release process.

## 7. Pipeline Validation and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2, 35.3, 35.4, 35.5, 35.6
### Description: Validate the entire CI/CD pipeline for correctness, reliability, and performance. Set up monitoring and alerting for pipeline failures.
### Details:
Run end-to-end tests of the pipeline, including simulated failures. Verify all stages (test, publish, coverage, dependency updates, release notes) execute as expected. Set up notifications for failed builds and monitor pipeline health over time.
