# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement caching system for optimization results
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8, 9, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a caching system to speed up subsequent optimizations of the same project.
# Details:
1. Create src/optimizationCache.js
2. Implement cache storage and retrieval functions
3. Define cache invalidation rules
4. Handle cache versioning for tool updates
5. Implement file watching for cache updates
6. Optimize cache storage for large projects

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for cache operations and integration tests for optimization speedup

# Subtasks:
## 1. Cache Creation Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the foundational cache structure, including selection of cache type (in-memory, distributed, file-based), and initialize the cache with appropriate configuration parameters.
### Details:
Define cache interface and data structures. Choose technology (e.g., Redis, local memory, file system). Set up configuration for cache size, eviction policy, and persistence options. Ensure cache can be instantiated and accessed by the application.

## 2. Storage and Retrieval Logic Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Develop robust logic for storing data in the cache and retrieving it efficiently, including fallback mechanisms if the cache is unavailable.
### Details:
Implement methods for put/get operations. Integrate multi-layered cache checks (local, shared, original data store). Ensure thread safety and handle cache misses gracefully. Add circuit-breaker pattern for cache service unavailability.

## 3. Cache Invalidation Rules and Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 30.2
### Description: Define and implement rules for cache invalidation to ensure data consistency and freshness.
### Details:
Specify invalidation triggers (time-based TTL, event-based, manual). Implement logic for automatic and manual invalidation. Ensure invalidation propagates correctly in distributed scenarios. Validate that stale data is not served.

## 4. Cache Versioning Strategy [done]
### Dependencies: 30.3
### Description: Establish and implement a versioning system for cached data to support schema changes and backward compatibility.
### Details:
Design versioning metadata for cache entries. Implement logic to check and upgrade cache versions. Handle cache invalidation or migration when versions change. Document versioning policy for future maintenance.

## 5. File Watching and Change Detection [done]
### Dependencies: 30.4
### Description: Implement file watching mechanisms to detect changes in source files and trigger cache updates or invalidation as needed.
### Details:
Set up file system watchers for relevant directories/files. Integrate with cache invalidation logic to refresh or remove affected cache entries upon file changes. Ensure efficient and reliable event handling.

## 6. Storage Optimization and Resource Management [done]
### Dependencies: 30.5
### Description: Optimize cache storage for performance and resource utilization, including eviction policies and data compression.
### Details:
Implement and tune eviction strategies (LRU, LFU, custom). Add support for data compression and decompression. Monitor cache size and resource usage. Provide configuration options for tuning storage parameters.

## 7. Comprehensive Testing and Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and execute a thorough testing plan covering all cache functionalities, edge cases, and failure scenarios.
### Details:
Write unit, integration, and stress tests for cache creation, storage/retrieval, invalidation, versioning, file watching, and optimization. Validate correctness, performance, and resilience. Ensure test coverage for fallback and recovery mechanisms.
