# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Advanced Turborepo Pipeline Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure advanced Turborepo pipeline dependencies, caching strategies, and task scheduling for optimal monorepo performance.
# Details:
1. Enhance the turbo.json configuration with advanced pipeline settings:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "globalDependencies": ["tsconfig.base.json"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"],
      "cache": true
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.ts", "tests/**/*.ts", "vitest.config.ts"],
      "outputs": ["coverage/**"],
      "cache": true
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": [],
      "cache": true
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    },
    "clean": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```
2. Add a clean script to each package's package.json:
```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rimraf dist coverage"
}
```
3. Add a clean script to the root package.json:
```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "turbo clean"
}
```
4. Configure remote caching for CI/CD (optional):
```json
// In turbo.json
{
  "remoteCache": {
    "signature": true
  }
}
```
5. Add rimraf as a dev dependency to the root package.json:
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "rimraf": "^5.0.5"
}
```
6. Create a .turbo directory in .gitignore to exclude local cache files
7. Configure package-specific cache inputs in each package's package.json:
```json
"turbo": {
  "extends": ["//"]
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test build pipeline with `pnpm build` and verify correct build order
2. Test incremental builds by making changes to one package and verifying only affected packages rebuild
3. Validate caching by running the same command twice and checking for cache hits
4. Test clean command functionality
5. Measure build performance improvements with and without caching
6. Verify parallel task execution for independent packages
7. Test pipeline with various combinations of package changes to ensure correct dependency resolution

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Update turbo.json Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the current turbo.json and enhance it to support advanced pipeline features, including custom tasks, dependencies, and output configurations.
### Details:
Ensure turbo.json includes all necessary pipelines, uses appropriate inputs/outputs, and leverages features like $TURBO_DEFAULT$ and $TURBO_ROOT$ for granular control.

## 2. Add and Integrate Clean Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create clean scripts for each package and integrate them into the turbo pipeline to ensure build artifacts are properly removed.
### Details:
Define clean scripts in each package's package.json and reference them in turbo.json as tasks, ensuring they run before builds as needed.

## 3. Configure Remote Caching in turbo.json [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Set up remote caching to optimize build performance and enable cache sharing across environments.
### Details:
Update turbo.json with remote cache provider settings and ensure authentication/secrets are handled securely.

## 4. Update .gitignore for Cache and Build Artifacts [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Modify the .gitignore file to exclude turbo cache directories and build outputs, preventing unnecessary files from being tracked.
### Details:
Add patterns for .turbo, dist, .next, and any other relevant directories to .gitignore, using $TURBO_DEFAULT$ as needed for turbo configuration.

## 5. Set Up Package-Specific Cache Inputs [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.3
### Description: Configure each package to specify its own cache inputs for turbo tasks, allowing for granular cache invalidation.
### Details:
Edit package-level turbo.json or package.json files to define inputs arrays, using $TURBO_DEFAULT$ and package-specific globs as appropriate.

## 6. Validate and Test Pipeline Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Run the enhanced pipeline to verify correct behavior, cache effectiveness, and overall performance improvements.
### Details:
Execute builds and cleans, monitor cache hits/misses, and compare build times before and after enhancements.

## 7. Document Configuration and Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update project documentation to explain the new turbo.json structure, clean scripts, caching setup, and .gitignore changes.
### Details:
Provide clear instructions for developers on running tasks, leveraging cache, and maintaining the configuration.
