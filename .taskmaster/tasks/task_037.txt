# Task ID: 37
# Title: Implement Framework Integration Hooks and Build Tool Plugins
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 25
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive integration system to connect Tailwind Enigma with major frontend frameworks and build tools, enabling seamless build process hooks, optimization, and HMR support.
# Details:
Design and implement a modular plugin architecture that supports integration with Webpack, Vite, Next.js (both pages and app router), React, Rollup, ESBuild, and Parcel. For each build tool, create a dedicated plugin module that hooks into the respective build lifecycle (e.g., Webpack's compiler hooks, Vite's plugin API, Rollup's plugin interface, etc.), enabling Enigma to inject, optimize, and manage Tailwind CSS assets. Implement framework-specific optimization strategies, such as tree-shaking unused classes for React and Next.js, and leverage framework detection (from Task 25) to auto-configure integration. Develop a configuration auto-detection system that reads and adapts to existing build tool and framework configs (e.g., webpack.config.js, vite.config.js, next.config.js). Ensure robust handling of development vs production modes, enabling HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for rapid feedback during development and production-optimized output. Design a plugin API for extensibility, allowing third-party plugins to hook into the integration system. Document the integration process and provide clear extension points for future frameworks and tools.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create test projects for each supported framework and build tool (Webpack, Vite, Next.js, React, Rollup, ESBuild, Parcel). 2. Verify that Enigma integrates automatically, injects optimized Tailwind CSS, and adapts to configuration changes. 3. Test HMR functionality in development mode for each tool. 4. Validate production builds for correct CSS output and optimizations. 5. Use the framework detection system to ensure correct auto-configuration. 6. Write unit and integration tests for plugin APIs and lifecycle hooks. 7. Confirm extensibility by developing a sample third-party plugin and verifying its integration.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Core Integration Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the foundational architecture for Tailwind Enigma's integration system with framework detection capabilities
### Details:
Create a modular plugin architecture that serves as the foundation for all framework integrations. Implement the core detection system that identifies the project's framework and build tools based on configuration files and dependencies. Design the plugin registry and lifecycle hooks that will be used across all integrations. Establish the configuration schema for integration settings and develop the auto-detection system that reads existing build tool configs (webpack.config.js, vite.config.js, next.config.js).

## 2. Implement Webpack and ESBuild Integration Plugins [done]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Develop dedicated integration plugins for Webpack and ESBuild build tools with optimization strategies
### Details:
Create Webpack integration by implementing compiler hooks that inject and manage Tailwind CSS assets. Develop ESBuild plugin that simplifies integration with monolith frameworks like Django or ASP.NET. Implement tree-shaking for unused Tailwind classes to optimize bundle size. Ensure proper handling of development vs. production modes with HMR support for rapid feedback during development. Add specific optimizations for each build tool based on their unique capabilities.

## 3. Implement Vite and Rollup Integration Plugins [done]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Create dedicated plugins for Vite and Rollup build tools with framework-specific optimizations
### Details:
Develop Vite plugin utilizing its plugin API to hook into the build lifecycle. Create Rollup plugin that interfaces with Rollup's plugin system. Implement framework-specific optimization strategies for both tools, focusing on performance and developer experience. Ensure proper asset handling and CSS optimization. Add support for HMR in development mode and production optimizations for deployment builds.

## 4. Implement Next.js and React Framework Integrations [done]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Develop specialized integration modules for Next.js (both pages and app router) and React applications
### Details:
Create Next.js integration supporting both the pages router and app router architectures. Implement React-specific optimizations including component-level CSS extraction and tree-shaking. Develop automatic configuration for Next.js projects based on detected project structure. Ensure proper handling of server-side rendering scenarios. Implement specialized hooks for React's component lifecycle to optimize Tailwind CSS usage.

## 5. Develop Extension API and Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 37.2, 37.3, 37.4
### Description: Create a plugin API for third-party extensions and comprehensive documentation for all integrations
### Details:
Design and implement an extensible plugin API allowing third-party developers to hook into the integration system. Create comprehensive documentation covering integration processes for all supported frameworks and build tools. Develop example implementations and starter templates for common integration scenarios. Include clear extension points documentation for future frameworks and tools. Create troubleshooting guides and performance optimization recommendations.
