# Task ID: 6
# Title: Migrate CLI Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Migrate the command-line interface and developer tools from the current monolithic package to the @tw-enigma/cli package.
# Details:
1. Identify all CLI-related modules in the current codebase
2. Create appropriate directory structure in packages/cli/src/ to organize the CLI functionality:
```
src/
├── commands/
├── utils/
└── index.ts
```
3. Move CLI command implementations to packages/cli/src/commands/
4. Move CLI-specific utilities to packages/cli/src/utils/
5. Update the bin/enigma.ts entry point to use the command structure:
```ts
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { Command } from 'commander';
import { version } from '../src';
import { registerCommands } from '../src/commands';

const program = new Command();

program.version(version).description('tw-enigma CSS optimization tool');

// Register all commands
registerCommands(program);

program.parse(process.argv);
```
6. Create a commands/index.ts file to register all commands:
```ts
import { Command } from 'commander';
import { registerOptimizeCommand } from './optimize';

export function registerCommands(program: Command): void {
  registerOptimizeCommand(program);
  // Register other commands here
}
```
7. Implement each command in separate files (e.g., commands/optimize.ts)
8. Update imports to use @tw-enigma/core for optimization functionality
9. Ensure all CLI-specific dependencies are added to package.json
10. Update package.json bin field to point to the correct binary path

# Test Strategy:
1. Migrate tests related to CLI functionality to packages/cli/tests/
2. Create test fixtures in packages/cli/tests/fixtures/
3. Update test imports to reference the new package structure
4. Run tests with `pnpm --filter @tw-enigma/cli test`
5. Verify all CLI functionality tests pass
6. Test the CLI binary with various commands and options
7. Create integration tests that validate the CLI works with the core package
8. Test error handling and edge cases in the CLI interface

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Existing CLI Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Catalog all current CLI modules, commands, and utilities in the project to establish a migration baseline.
### Details:
Review the codebase and documentation to list all CLI modules, their commands, and associated utilities.

## 2. Analyze Command Structure and Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Map out the structure of CLI commands and their dependencies on internal and external modules.
### Details:
Document how commands are organized, their invocation patterns, and any dependencies on the core package or third-party libraries.

## 3. Plan Migration Strategy for CLI Commands and Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop a migration plan detailing how each CLI command and utility will be moved or refactored.
### Details:
Determine which commands/utilities require refactoring, which can be moved as-is, and outline the migration steps for each.

## 4. Migrate CLI Commands and Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Execute the migration of CLI commands and utilities according to the migration plan.
### Details:
Move or refactor code, ensuring compatibility with the new structure and integration points.

## 5. Update CLI Entry Point [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Modify the CLI entry point to reflect the new command structure and ensure proper routing of commands.
### Details:
Update the main CLI script or entry file to import and register migrated commands and utilities.

## 6. Integrate CLI with Core Package [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Ensure the migrated CLI commands and utilities are properly integrated with the core package.
### Details:
Refactor code as needed to use core package APIs, ensuring seamless interaction between CLI and core logic.

## 7. Update and Audit Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and update project dependencies to support the new CLI structure and remove obsolete packages.
### Details:
Update dependency files, ensure compatibility, and remove unused or deprecated packages.

## 8. Validate Migration with Tests and Manual CLI Runs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run automated tests and perform manual CLI executions to verify correct behavior and user experience.
### Details:
Execute unit, integration, and end-to-end tests; manually run CLI commands to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
