# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement HTML class extraction using cheerio
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to extract class patterns from HTML files using cheerio library.
# Details:
1. Install cheerio: npm install cheerio@1.0.0-rc.12
2. Create src/htmlExtractor.js
3. Implement function to load HTML file with cheerio
4. Extract class attributes from all elements
5. Parse class strings into individual classes
6. Handle special cases like conditional classes

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with various HTML structures and class patterns

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Cheerio [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the project environment and install Cheerio library
### Details:
Initialize a new Node.js project with npm init, install Cheerio using npm install cheerio, verify installation by checking package.json dependencies, and create the basic project structure with necessary files (index.js, parser.js)

## 2. Implement HTML Loading Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create functions to load HTML content from various sources
### Details:
Implement functions to load HTML from strings, files, and URLs using cheerio.load() method, handle loading errors gracefully, create utility functions for different input types, and document the loading process with code comments

## 3. Develop Class Attribute Extraction [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create functions to extract class attributes from HTML elements
### Details:
Implement selectors to target elements with class attributes, extract the class attribute values using .attr('class'), create a function to process all elements with classes, handle elements with multiple classes, and build a collection of all class attributes found in the document

## 4. Implement Class Parsing Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Parse and analyze extracted class attributes
### Details:
Create functions to split multi-class strings into individual classes, normalize class names (trim whitespace, handle case sensitivity), implement frequency counting for class occurrences, identify class patterns and relationships, and create data structures to store parsed class information

## 5. Handle Special Cases and Edge Conditions [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Implement robust handling for special cases in HTML class parsing
### Details:
Add support for dynamically generated classes, handle malformed HTML gracefully, implement error recovery for parsing failures, account for special characters in class names, and create validation functions to ensure parsed data integrity

## 6. Create Testing and Validation Suite [done]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive tests for the HTML class parsing functionality
### Details:
Create unit tests for each parsing function, develop integration tests for the complete workflow, test with various HTML inputs (simple, complex, malformed), validate output against expected results, and implement performance benchmarking for optimization
