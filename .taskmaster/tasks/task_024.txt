# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement relative path calculation for CSS references
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to calculate relative paths for CSS file references in HTML files.
# Details:
1. Create src/pathUtils.js
2. Implement function to calculate relative path
3. Handle various directory structures
4. Normalize paths for cross-platform compatibility
5. Implement error handling for invalid paths
6. Add unit tests for various scenarios

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with various directory structures and file locations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Project Setup and Requirements Gathering [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the project structure, select necessary tools and libraries, and gather detailed requirements for utility creation, path calculation, directory handling, normalization, error handling, and testing.
### Details:
Create a new repository or project workspace. Document all functional and non-functional requirements. Identify cross-platform considerations and edge cases for path and directory handling. Define success metrics and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Implement Utility Creation Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Develop the foundational utility functions and classes that will support path calculation, directory handling, and normalization.
### Details:
Design and implement reusable utility modules. Ensure modularity and extensibility for future enhancements. Include documentation and inline comments for maintainability.

## 3. Develop Path Calculation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Implement robust path calculation algorithms, ensuring correct resolution of relative and absolute paths, and handling platform-specific path separators.
### Details:
Write functions to join, resolve, and manipulate file paths. Address edge cases such as symbolic links, redundant separators, and invalid paths. Validate correctness with sample inputs.

## 4. Directory Handling and Normalization [done]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Create utilities for directory creation, existence checks, and normalization of directory paths to a consistent format.
### Details:
Implement functions to create directories recursively, check for directory existence, and normalize directory paths (e.g., removing trailing slashes, resolving '..' and '.'). Ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## 5. Comprehensive Error Handling Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Integrate thorough error handling across all utilities, covering invalid inputs, permission issues, and platform-specific errors.
### Details:
Define custom error types where appropriate. Ensure all functions gracefully handle and report errors. Add logging or error reporting hooks as needed.

## 6. Testing, Validation, and Edge Case Coverage [done]
### Dependencies: 24.5
### Description: Develop and execute a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests for all utilities, focusing on edge cases and cross-platform scenarios.
### Details:
Write tests for all utility functions, including path calculation, directory handling, and normalization. Test error handling paths and platform-specific behaviors. Validate against requirements and acceptance criteria.
