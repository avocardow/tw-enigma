# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement dry run mode
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a dry run mode to preview optimizations without modifying files.
# Details:
1. Add --dry-run flag to CLI
2. Implement mock file system for dry runs
3. Generate optimization preview report
4. Show potential file changes without writing
5. Provide statistics on expected optimizations
6. Implement visual diff output for changes

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with various project fixtures in dry run mode

# Subtasks:
## 1. CLI Flag Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add dry run mode flag to the command line interface
### Details:
Implement a '--dry-run' flag with alias '-d' that enables simulation mode. Follow CLI design best practices by adding proper documentation, help text, and ensuring the flag works consistently with other existing flags. Update the command parsing logic to detect and process this flag.

## 2. Mock File System Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Create a virtual file system layer for simulating operations
### Details:
Develop an abstraction layer that intercepts all file system operations (read, write, delete, etc.) and simulates them in memory when dry run mode is active. Implement proper state tracking to maintain consistency throughout the simulation. Ensure the mock system accurately reflects what would happen in a real execution.

## 3. Change Simulation Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.2
### Description: Build the core simulation logic that executes operations without side effects
### Details:
Implement the simulation engine that processes all operations through the mock file system. Create hooks for all state-changing operations to route them through the simulation layer when dry run is enabled. Ensure all potential side effects are captured and simulated, including error conditions and edge cases.

## 4. Statistics Calculation Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.3
### Description: Develop metrics collection for simulated operations
### Details:
Create a statistics module that tracks and aggregates metrics during simulation, including counts of files modified, created, or deleted, execution time estimates, and resource usage projections. Implement categorization of changes by type and severity to provide meaningful insights in the preview report.

## 5. Diff Output Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.3, 28.4
### Description: Create detailed before/after comparisons of simulated changes
### Details:
Implement a diff generation system that produces human-readable comparisons between the initial and simulated final states. Include formatting for different types of changes (text files, binary files, directory structures) and highlight critical changes. Ensure the diff output is clear and actionable for users reviewing the simulation results.

## 6. Preview Report Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.4, 28.5
### Description: Create comprehensive simulation results report
### Details:
Develop a report generator that combines statistics, diffs, and execution details into a cohesive preview of what would happen during actual execution. Include summary sections, detailed change listings, potential warnings or errors, and recommendations. Ensure the report is formatted appropriately for both terminal output and potential file export.
