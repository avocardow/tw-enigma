# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement file integrity validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to validate file integrity before and after modifications.
# Details:
1. Create src/fileIntegrity.js
2. Implement checksum calculation function
3. Create validation checks for before and after modification
4. Implement rollback mechanism for failed validations
5. Add logging for integrity checks
6. Optimize for performance with large files

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for various file types and modification scenarios

# Subtasks:
## 1. File Creation System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a robust file creation mechanism with proper error handling
### Details:
Design and implement a file creation system that handles various file types, includes proper permissions management, validates input parameters, implements timeout handling, and provides clear error messages. Include functionality to create files in specified directories with appropriate metadata.

## 2. Checksum Calculation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop checksum calculation functionality using multiple algorithms
### Details:
Implement checksum calculation using multiple algorithms (CRC, MD5, SHA variants) for file integrity verification. Create functions to generate checksums for individual files and directories of files. Store checksums in a standardized format that includes algorithm type, timestamp, and file path information.

## 3. Validation Check Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Create a comprehensive validation system for file integrity verification
### Details:
Develop a validation framework that compares calculated checksums against expected values, implements threshold-based validation for partial matches, provides detailed validation reports, and integrates with the logging system. Include functionality to validate files individually or in batches.

## 4. Rollback Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.3
### Description: Implement a reliable rollback system for file modifications
### Details:
Design and implement a rollback mechanism that creates backups before file modifications, maintains a transaction log of changes, provides atomic rollback operations, and includes verification of successful rollbacks using checksums. Ensure the system can handle partial rollbacks and cascading dependencies.

## 5. Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Develop a comprehensive logging framework for all operations
### Details:
Implement a logging system that records all file operations, checksum calculations, validation results, and rollback actions. Include timestamps, user information, operation details, and outcome status. Provide configurable log levels, rotation policies, and search/filter capabilities.

## 6. Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3, 16.5
### Description: Optimize system performance for large files and high-volume operations
### Details:
Implement performance optimizations including parallel processing for batch operations, caching mechanisms for frequently accessed files, streaming for large file handling, and resource management to prevent memory leaks. Conduct benchmarking and establish performance metrics for different file sizes and operation types.

## 7. Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4, 16.5, 16.6
### Description: Create comprehensive testing suite for all implemented functionality
### Details:
Develop a testing framework with unit tests for individual components, integration tests for system interactions, performance tests under various loads, edge case testing for error conditions, and security testing for potential vulnerabilities. Include automated test execution and reporting capabilities.
