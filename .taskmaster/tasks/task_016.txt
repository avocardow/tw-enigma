# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement file integrity validation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to validate file integrity before and after modifications.
# Details:
1. Create src/fileIntegrity.js
2. Implement checksum calculation function
3. Create validation checks for before and after modification
4. Implement rollback mechanism for failed validations
5. Add logging for integrity checks
6. Optimize for performance with large files

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for various file types and modification scenarios

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design file integrity validation architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core architecture for the file integrity validation system following the modular design pattern in src/cssInjector.ts
### Details:
Create src/fileIntegrity.ts with TypeScript interfaces and classes for the validation system. Define the main FileIntegrityValidator class with methods for checksum calculation and validation. Implement Zod schemas for validation configuration and results. Follow the modular design patterns established in the codebase.

## 2. Implement checksum calculation using Node.js crypto module [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop functions to calculate file checksums using the Node.js crypto module instead of external dependencies
### Details:
Implement checksum calculation functions using Node.js crypto module's createHash method. Support multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-256) with SHA-256 as default. Create utility functions for both synchronous and asynchronous checksum generation. Optimize for handling large files using streams to minimize memory usage.

## 3. Create validation system for file integrity checks [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Implement the validation logic to compare checksums before and after file modifications
### Details:
Develop functions to store initial checksums, perform validation checks after modifications, and determine if file integrity has been maintained. Integrate with the existing error handling system to properly report integrity violations. Create a validation results object with detailed information about the validation process.

## 4. Implement rollback mechanism for failed validations [done]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Create a system to restore files to their original state when integrity validation fails
### Details:
Implement a backup and restore mechanism that creates temporary copies of files before modifications. Develop the rollback function that restores the original file when validation fails. Ensure proper error handling during the rollback process. Integrate with the existing logging system to record rollback events.

## 5. Integrate with configuration and logging systems [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Connect the file integrity validation system with existing configuration and logging infrastructure
### Details:
Integrate the file integrity validation system with the existing configuration system to allow customization of validation parameters. Implement comprehensive logging for all integrity check operations, validation results, and rollback actions. Ensure logs contain sufficient detail for debugging and audit purposes. Create configuration options for performance optimization with large files.
