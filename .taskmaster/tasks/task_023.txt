# Task ID: 23
# Title: Develop atomic file operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a system for atomic file operations to ensure data integrity during modifications.
# Details:
1. Create src/atomicFileOps.js
2. Implement functions for atomic read, write, and delete operations
3. Use temporary files for write operations
4. Implement rollback mechanism for failed operations
5. Handle permissions and file locking
6. Optimize for performance with large files

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for various file operation scenarios, including error cases

# Subtasks:
## 1. File Creation System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a robust file creation mechanism that ensures atomicity
### Details:
Design and implement a file creation system that handles initial file creation atomically. Include proper error handling for cases where creation might be interrupted. Ensure the system can detect and recover from partial creation scenarios. Implement file existence verification before attempting creation to prevent overwriting existing files.

## 2. Atomic Read/Write Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Develop core atomic read and write operations with failure handling
### Details:
Implement read operations that follow the procedure: check if target file exists, if not check for temporary file, throw appropriate errors when neither exists. For write operations, implement a system that ensures changes are either fully applied or fully rejected, even during power loss. Include buffer management and proper file descriptor/stream handling for both operations.

## 3. Temporary File Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Create a comprehensive temporary file handling system
### Details:
Develop a temporary file creation and management system that supports atomic operations. Implement naming conventions for temp files (e.g., using .tmp extension or UUID-based names). Create mechanisms for proper cleanup of temporary files after successful operations or system failures. Include timeout handling for abandoned temporary files.

## 4. Rollback Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2, 23.3
### Description: Implement a reliable rollback system for failed operations
### Details:
Design and implement a rollback mechanism that can restore the system to a consistent state after operation failures. Create logging of operation steps to enable proper rollback. Implement state tracking to determine the appropriate rollback actions. Develop cleanup procedures that handle various failure scenarios including partial writes and interrupted operations.

## 5. Permission Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2
### Description: Develop a comprehensive file permission management system
### Details:
Implement permission checking before file operations to prevent runtime errors. Create permission preservation mechanisms during atomic operations to ensure temporary files and renamed files maintain the same permissions as the original. Develop error handling specific to permission-related failures. Include support for different user contexts and security models.

## 6. Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2, 23.3, 23.4
### Description: Optimize atomic file operations for performance while maintaining reliability
### Details:
Implement buffering strategies to minimize disk I/O. Develop batch operation capabilities for multiple atomic operations. Create performance metrics collection to identify bottlenecks. Optimize file system interactions based on different operating systems. Implement configurable performance parameters (buffer sizes, timeout values, etc.).

## 7. Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1, 23.2, 23.3, 23.4, 23.5, 23.6
### Description: Create comprehensive testing suite for atomic file operations
### Details:
Develop unit tests for each atomic operation type. Create integration tests that verify atomicity across system components. Implement stress tests to verify behavior under high load. Design failure simulation tests that mimic power outages, disk failures, and other error conditions. Create validation tools to verify file integrity after operations.
