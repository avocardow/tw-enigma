# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement pattern validation against Tailwind class list
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a system to validate detected patterns against a list of valid Tailwind classes.
# Details:
1. Create src/patternValidator.js
2. Generate or obtain a comprehensive list of Tailwind classes
3. Implement validation function for individual classes
4. Handle custom Tailwind configurations
5. Provide warnings for potentially invalid classes
6. Optimize for performance with large pattern sets

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with various class patterns and Tailwind configurations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Validator Creation Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational structure for validator creation, including project scaffolding, dependency installation, and initial configuration.
### Details:
Set up the development environment, initialize version control, install necessary libraries (e.g., validation frameworks), and define base interfaces or abstract classes for validators.

## 2. Class List Generation Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Develop the logic to dynamically generate and manage the list of classes or entities to be validated.
### Details:
Implement mechanisms to scan, register, or import classes/entities requiring validation. Ensure extensibility for future additions and support for batch processing of large class sets.

## 3. Validation Logic Development and Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 22.2
### Description: Implement core validation logic, including rule definition, cross-referencing patterns, and comprehensive unit/integration testing.
### Details:
Define validation rules for each class/entity, handle cross-referencing between related entities, and ensure logic supports both synchronous and asynchronous validation. Write thorough tests to cover edge cases and expected behaviors.

## 4. Custom Configuration Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 22.3
### Description: Design and implement support for custom configuration files or parameters, enabling flexible validation rule overrides and extensions.
### Details:
Create parsers/loaders for custom config formats (e.g., JSON, YAML), merge custom configs with default settings, and validate config integrity. Add tests for config parsing and error handling.

## 5. Warning Generation and Reporting [done]
### Dependencies: 22.4
### Description: Develop a robust warning generation system to flag non-critical issues, with clear reporting and user feedback mechanisms.
### Details:
Implement logic to detect and generate warnings during validation, categorize warning types, and design reporting interfaces (e.g., logs, UI notifications). Ensure warnings are actionable and traceable to specific validation steps.

## 6. Performance Optimization and Scalability Testing [done]
### Dependencies: 22.5
### Description: Profile and optimize the validator for performance, especially with large class/entity sets, and conduct scalability testing.
### Details:
Identify bottlenecks in validation and class list generation, implement caching or parallelization where appropriate, and benchmark performance. Test with large datasets to ensure responsiveness and stability under load.
