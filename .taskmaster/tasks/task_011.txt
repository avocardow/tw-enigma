2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Build all packages: `pnpm build`
4. Make your changes in the appropriate package
5. Run tests: `pnpm test`
6. Submit a pull request

## Package Development

### Working on a specific package

```bash
# Start development mode for a specific package
pnpm --filter @tw-enigma/core dev

# Run tests for a specific package
pnpm --filter @tw-enigma/cli test
```

## Release Process

Releases are managed through GitHub Actions when tags are pushed.
