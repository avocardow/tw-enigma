# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop basic error handling and logging framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a centralized error handling and logging system using chalk for user-friendly output.
# Details:
1. Install chalk: npm install chalk@5.2.0
2. Create src/logger.js
3. Implement functions for info, warning, error, and success logging
4. Use chalk for color-coded output
5. Implement verbose logging option
6. Create custom error classes for specific error types

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each log type and error scenario

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and configure chalk package [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the chalk package for color-coded console output in the logging system
### Details:
Install chalk using npm or yarn, verify the installation, and create a simple test to ensure chalk is working properly. Document the available color options and how they will be mapped to different log levels.

## 2. Create logger module structure [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop the core logger module with proper structured logging format
### Details:
Create a logger class/module that follows structured logging best practices. Implement JSON formatting for logs, standardize timestamp format, include contextual information like session IDs, and ensure logs can be easily parsed by analysis tools. Set up the logger to be easily imported across the application.

## 3. Implement log levels with appropriate filtering [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Add support for different log levels (FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE) with filtering capability
### Details:
Define all log levels with clear documentation on when each should be used. Implement methods for each log level and create a mechanism to filter logs based on the current application environment. Ensure log level configuration can be changed at runtime without application restart.

## 4. Add color coding to log output [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3
### Description: Integrate chalk to provide color-coded console output based on log levels
### Details:
Map each log level to an appropriate color scheme using chalk. Implement color coding that works in different terminal environments. Create a configuration option to disable colors for environments where ANSI color codes aren't supported. Test color output in various terminal environments.

## 5. Implement verbose logging option [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Add a configurable verbose mode that controls the detail level of logs
### Details:
Create a verbose flag that can be set via environment variables or command line arguments. Implement additional detailed logging when verbose mode is enabled. Add context-specific verbose logging that includes stack traces, request details, and system information when appropriate. Test verbose mode in different scenarios.

## 6. Create custom error classes with logging integration [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Develop custom error classes that automatically integrate with the logging system
### Details:
Design a base custom error class that extends the standard Error object. Add properties for error codes, severity levels, and additional context. Implement automatic logging of errors when they're created. Create specific error subclasses for different error categories (e.g., ValidationError, NetworkError, DatabaseError). Ensure proper stack trace preservation.
