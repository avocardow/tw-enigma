# Task ID: 5
# Title: Migrate Core Optimization Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Migrate the CSS optimization engine and processing logic from the current monolithic package to the @tw-enigma/core package.
# Details:
1. Identify all core optimization modules in the current codebase
2. Create appropriate directory structure in packages/core/src/ to organize the optimization logic:
```
src/
├── engine/
├── processors/
├── utils/
└── index.ts
```
3. Move optimization engine code to packages/core/src/engine/
4. Move CSS processors to packages/core/src/processors/
5. Move utility functions to packages/core/src/utils/
6. Update import paths throughout the migrated code
7. Create a comprehensive index.ts that exports all public API functions:
```ts
// Re-export from engine
export * from './engine/optimizer';
export * from './engine/parser';

// Re-export from processors
export * from './processors/css';
export * from './processors/tailwind';

// Export types
export * from './types';

// Version export
export const version = '0.1.0';
```
8. Create a types.ts file for shared type definitions
9. Ensure all dependencies required by the core functionality are added to the package.json
10. Update tsconfig.json if additional configuration is needed for the migrated code

# Test Strategy:
1. Migrate tests related to core functionality to packages/core/tests/
2. Create test fixtures in packages/core/tests/fixtures/
3. Update test imports to reference the new package structure
4. Run tests with `pnpm --filter @tw-enigma/core test`
5. Verify all core functionality tests pass
6. Create integration tests that validate the exported API functions
7. Test edge cases to ensure optimization logic works as expected
8. Benchmark performance to ensure no regression from the original implementation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Modules to Migrate [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing codebase to determine which modules (engine, processors, utils, etc.) need to be migrated. Document their current structure, dependencies, and owners.
### Details:
Create an inventory of all modules, their relationships, and any critical dependencies to ensure nothing is overlooked during migration.

## 2. Define New Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Design and document the new directory structure for the migrated modules, ensuring it supports scalability and maintainability.
### Details:
Map out the new folder hierarchy and file organization, considering best practices for modular codebases.

## 3. Migrate Engine Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Move the engine module to the new directory structure, refactoring as necessary to fit the new architecture.
### Details:
Ensure all engine-related files are relocated and updated to match the new structure.

## 4. Migrate Processors and Utils Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Relocate the processors and utils modules to the new directory structure, updating code as needed.
### Details:
Refactor code to align with the new structure and resolve any immediate issues from the move.

## 5. Update Imports Across Codebase [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Update all import statements throughout the codebase to reference the new module locations.
### Details:
Perform a comprehensive search and replace, and manually verify critical paths to prevent broken imports.

## 6. Create Index and Types Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Add or update index files and type definition files in the new directory structure to facilitate module exports and type safety.
### Details:
Ensure all modules are properly exported and types are accessible where needed.

## 7. Update and Validate Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.5, 5.6
### Description: Review and update package dependencies to ensure compatibility with the new structure. Remove obsolete dependencies and add any new required ones.
### Details:
Check package.json or equivalent files, and run dependency audits to catch issues early.

## 8. Validate Migration with Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run the full test suite to validate that the migration did not introduce regressions. Address any test failures and ensure all functionality is intact.
### Details:
Perform both automated and manual testing as needed, and document any issues or follow-up actions.
