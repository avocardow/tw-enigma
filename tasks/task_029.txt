# Task ID: 29
# Title: Develop custom Tailwind plugin for optimized classes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a Tailwind plugin to integrate optimized classes into the development workflow.
# Details:
1. Create src/tailwindPlugin.js
2. Implement Tailwind plugin structure
3. Generate utility classes for optimized patterns
4. Provide autocomplete support for optimized classes
5. Implement hot reloading support
6. Create documentation for plugin usage

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with Tailwind and various project setups

# Subtasks:
## 1. Plugin Creation Setup and Boilerplate [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational structure for the custom Tailwind plugin, including project scaffolding, configuration files, and initial plugin registration.
### Details:
Set up a new project directory. Initialize package.json and install Tailwind CSS as a dependency. Create a basic plugin file (e.g., index.js) and register it in the Tailwind config. Ensure the plugin is recognized by running a minimal build.

## 2. Utility Class Generation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Develop the logic for generating custom utility classes within the plugin, ensuring compatibility with Tailwind's utility-first approach.
### Details:
Define the custom utilities to be generated (e.g., spacing, colors, custom properties). Implement the plugin logic to inject these utilities into Tailwind's build process. Validate that the generated classes appear in the output CSS and function as expected.

## 3. Autocomplete Support Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Enable IDE and editor autocomplete for the new utility classes by generating appropriate metadata or configuration files.
### Details:
Research and implement support for editor plugins (e.g., VSCode Tailwind IntelliSense). Generate or update JSON or TypeScript definition files that describe the new utilities. Test in a supported editor to confirm autocomplete suggestions appear for custom classes.

## 4. Hot Reloading and Development Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Configure hot reloading to ensure changes to the plugin or utility classes are reflected instantly during development.
### Details:
Set up a watch script (e.g., using tailwindcss --watch or integration with Vite) to rebuild CSS on file changes. Ensure that updates to the plugin or utility definitions trigger a rebuild and are visible in the browser without manual refresh. Validate the workflow by making changes and observing live updates.

## 5. Documentation and Usage Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Write comprehensive documentation for the plugin, including setup instructions, usage examples, and API references.
### Details:
Document installation steps, configuration options, and all available utility classes. Provide code samples and before/after examples. Ensure documentation is clear, accurate, and accessible (e.g., in a README.md or dedicated docs site).

## 6. Integration and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Develop and execute tests to verify the plugin's integration with Tailwind and its correct behavior in real-world scenarios.
### Details:
Write automated tests to check that the plugin generates the expected CSS output. Create sample projects or components that use the plugin and validate their appearance and functionality. Test compatibility with different Tailwind versions and build tools. Address any issues found during testing.
