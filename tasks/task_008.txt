# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create pattern frequency map generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to generate a frequency map of class patterns from extracted data.
# Details:
1. Create src/patternAnalysis.js
2. Implement function to process extracted classes
3. Generate Map<string, number> for pattern frequencies
4. Handle single classes and multi-class patterns
5. Implement sorting by frequency for optimization
6. Add threshold for minimum frequency to consider

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for various input scenarios and frequency calculations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Data Structures for Class Extraction [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement data structures to store and represent extracted classes and their occurrences from the input data.
### Details:
Define appropriate data types (e.g., arrays, hash maps, or objects) to hold class labels and their associated metadata. Ensure compatibility with downstream processing steps.

## 2. Implement Frequency Map Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop logic to iterate through the extracted classes and count the frequency of each class, storing the results in a frequency map.
### Details:
Traverse the data structure containing extracted classes, incrementing counts in a hash map or similar structure for each class encountered. Validate that all classes are accounted for and frequencies are accurate.

## 3. Handle Multi-Class Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Extend frequency mapping and data structures to support and correctly process cases where multiple classes are present in a single data instance.
### Details:
Update extraction and counting logic to handle lists or sets of classes per instance. Ensure that frequency counts reflect all class occurrences, including those in multi-class patterns.

## 4. Sort Classes by Frequency [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Implement sorting of classes based on their frequency, supporting both ascending and descending order as required.
### Details:
Use the frequency map to generate a sorted list or array of classes. Implement sorting logic that can handle ties (e.g., secondary sort by class label) and is optimized for performance with large datasets.

## 5. Apply Frequency Thresholding [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Develop logic to filter classes based on configurable frequency thresholds, retaining only those classes that meet the specified criteria.
### Details:
Allow for dynamic threshold input (e.g., minimum or maximum frequency). Ensure that the filtering step is robust and integrates seamlessly with the sorted class list.

## 6. Test and Validate Processing Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Design and execute comprehensive tests to verify the correctness and robustness of class extraction, frequency mapping, multi-class handling, sorting, and thresholding.
### Details:
Create unit and integration tests covering edge cases (e.g., empty input, all unique classes, all identical classes, multi-class overlaps). Validate outputs against expected results and document test coverage.
