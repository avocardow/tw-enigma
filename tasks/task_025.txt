# Task ID: 25
# Title: Develop framework detection mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a system to detect the framework used in the project for optimized processing.
# Details:
1. Create src/frameworkDetector.js
2. Implement detection logic for React, Next.js, and Vite
3. Analyze package.json and config files
4. Provide framework-specific optimizations
5. Handle multi-framework projects
6. Implement fallback for unknown frameworks

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests with mock project structures for various frameworks

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initial Setup and Requirements Gathering [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the project environment, gather requirements for detector creation, and define supported frameworks and configuration sources.
### Details:
Set up version control, project structure, and development tools. Document all frameworks to be supported and the types of configuration files and patterns to analyze. Identify stakeholders and clarify acceptance criteria.

## 2. Framework Detector Creation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Implement core logic to detect frameworks based on file structure, configuration files, and code patterns.
### Details:
Develop pattern-matching algorithms for identifying frameworks. Create modular detectors for each framework. Ensure extensibility for future frameworks. Write unit tests for detection logic.

## 3. Framework-Specific Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Develop and integrate logic for handling the unique characteristics and detection nuances of each supported framework.
### Details:
For each framework, implement logic to parse relevant files, extract configuration details, and handle edge cases. Validate detection accuracy with real-world project samples. Document framework-specific behaviors.

## 4. Package and Dependency Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Analyze project dependencies and packages to enhance detection accuracy and gather additional metadata.
### Details:
Implement parsers for package managers (e.g., npm, pip, Maven). Extract and analyze dependency trees. Correlate package data with framework detection results. Add tests for various package scenarios.

## 5. Configuration File Analysis and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4
### Description: Develop logic to parse and validate configuration files for each framework, ensuring correct extraction of relevant settings.
### Details:
Identify key configuration files for each framework. Implement parsers and validators for these files. Handle malformed or missing configurations gracefully. Test with a variety of real and synthetic config files.

## 6. Multi-Framework Handling and Fallback Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.5
### Description: Implement logic to handle projects with multiple frameworks and provide robust fallback mechanisms for ambiguous or unsupported cases.
### Details:
Design and implement logic to detect and report multiple frameworks in a single project. Develop fallback strategies for unknown or partially detected frameworks. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for multi-framework and fallback scenarios.
