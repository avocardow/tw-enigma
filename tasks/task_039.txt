# Task ID: 39
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Configuration Validation and Safety System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a robust configuration validation system that ensures correctness, safety, and reliability of all configuration files and settings, including live validation, migration support, and recovery mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Integrate JSON schema validation for configuration files using a schema definition that enforces required fields, types, and constraints, providing detailed error messages for invalid configurations.
2. Implement runtime type checking and constraint validation to catch misconfigurations or unsafe values during application execution.
3. Set up file watching on configuration files to enable live validation and immediate feedback on changes, alerting users to errors or unsafe settings in real time.
4. Define and enforce safe default values and automatic fallback mechanisms for missing or invalid configuration entries, ensuring the system remains operational and secure.
5. Develop migration helpers to assist users in upgrading configuration files between versions, including automated migration scripts and clear warnings about deprecated or changed settings.
6. Add validation logic to detect and warn about configuration options that may negatively impact performance, with actionable suggestions for remediation.
7. Implement configuration backup and restoration features, automatically saving previous versions and enabling easy rollback in case of errors or corruption.
8. Ensure all configuration validation logic is covered by integration tests, simulating real-world scenarios including invalid, missing, or outdated configurations, and verifying error reporting and recovery mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
- Write unit and integration tests for schema validation, ensuring all required fields, types, and constraints are enforced and that error messages are clear and actionable.
- Simulate runtime misconfigurations and verify that type checking and constraint validation catch errors and trigger safe fallback mechanisms.
- Test file watching by modifying configuration files and confirming that live validation detects changes and provides immediate feedback.
- Validate that migration helpers correctly upgrade old configuration files and warn about deprecated settings.
- Intentionally introduce performance-impacting settings and verify that warnings are generated.
- Test backup and restoration by corrupting configuration files and confirming that the system can restore from backups without data loss.
- Run integration tests covering the full configuration lifecycle, including loading, validation, migration, backup, and recovery.
