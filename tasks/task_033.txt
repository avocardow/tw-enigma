# Test Strategy:
Validation of package structure and installation tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit and Update package.json Metadata [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and update all metadata fields in package.json to ensure accuracy, completeness, and adherence to best practices. This includes name, version, description, author, license, keywords, and repository fields.
### Details:
Check for missing or outdated fields. Remove unnecessary or unclear metadata. Ensure organization-wide scopes and consistent formatting. Validate JSON syntax.

## 2. Configure Included Files via package.json 'files' Field [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Define which files and directories should be included in the published npm package using the 'files' field in package.json.
### Details:
List only essential source files, documentation, and license. Exclude build artifacts, tests, and sensitive files. Cross-reference with .npmignore for consistency.

## 3. Set Up and Document npm Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Create, update, and document npm scripts in package.json for build, test, lint, and other automation tasks.
### Details:
Use clear, descriptive script names (e.g., 'build:client' instead of 'build-client'). Ensure scripts are functional and documented in the README. Test each script for expected behavior.

## 4. Create and Validate .npmignore File [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2
### Description: Create a .npmignore file to explicitly exclude files and directories from the npm package that should not be published.
### Details:
List files such as node_modules, test directories, local configs, and build artifacts. Validate that only intended files are included in the package using 'npm pack' or similar commands.

## 5. Configure package.json 'exports' Field [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Set up the 'exports' field in package.json to control module entry points and ensure proper usage for consumers.
### Details:
Define main and subpath exports for both CommonJS and ESM if needed. Test package import scenarios to verify correct resolution.

## 6. Implement and Validate Semantic Versioning [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Establish and document a semantic versioning strategy for the package, updating the version field and ensuring all dependencies follow semver best practices.
### Details:
Update the version field according to the nature of changes (major, minor, patch). Avoid version wildcards in dependencies. Document versioning policy in the README.
