# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement performance optimizations for large codebases
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish a performance-first foundation for the tool, ensuring that all core components are designed, measured, and validated with performance as a primary concern from the outset.
# Details:
1. Build a performance measurement and monitoring infrastructure early in the project lifecycle
2. Define and enforce performance-first design patterns and architectural guidelines
3. Set up comprehensive benchmarking and profiling frameworks for all major components
4. Establish clear performance budgets for execution time, memory usage, and resource consumption
5. Develop an early, automated performance testing framework to catch regressions and enforce budgets
6. Ensure all APIs and internal patterns are designed with performance constraints and extensibility in mind

# Test Strategy:
Establish baseline performance metrics and budgets. Integrate automated performance tests and monitoring into CI/CD. Validate that all new features and changes are measured against established budgets and tracked over time.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Worker Thread Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and implement worker threads for CPU-intensive operations
### Details:
Import worker_threads module, create worker files for heavy computations, implement communication channels between main thread and workers, and handle errors and thread termination properly. Avoid using Thread.Abort and follow thread safety best practices.

## 2. Regular Expression Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and optimize regex patterns for better performance
### Details:
Audit existing regex patterns, identify performance bottlenecks, implement regex caching, avoid catastrophic backtracking, use appropriate quantifiers, and benchmark regex performance before and after optimization.

## 3. Caching Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a comprehensive caching strategy
### Details:
Evaluate caching requirements, select appropriate caching mechanisms (memory, Redis, etc.), implement cache invalidation strategies, set up TTL policies, and create monitoring for cache hit/miss ratios.

## 4. Stream Processing Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement stream processing for handling large datasets
### Details:
Identify operations suitable for streaming, implement Node.js streams for file and network I/O, handle backpressure, implement proper error handling for streams, and create pipeline transformations for data processing.

## 5. Batch Processing System [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Design and implement batch processing for bulk operations
### Details:
Define batch size thresholds, implement queuing mechanism, create batch processing workers, implement retry logic for failed batches, and develop monitoring for batch processing performance.

## 6. Application Profiling Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive profiling for performance analysis
### Details:
Select appropriate profiling tools, implement CPU and memory profiling, set up flame graphs for visualization, create baseline performance metrics, and implement continuous profiling in development environment.

## 7. Memory Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.6
### Description: Analyze and optimize memory usage patterns
### Details:
Identify memory leaks using heap snapshots, implement proper garbage collection practices, optimize object creation and reuse, implement buffer pooling for I/O operations, and monitor memory consumption patterns.

## 8. Performance Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.7
### Description: Create comprehensive performance tests for all optimizations
### Details:
Develop load testing scenarios, implement benchmarking suite, create performance regression tests, establish performance baselines and targets, and document performance improvements for each optimization area.

## 9. Establish Performance Budgets and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and enforce performance budgets for all major components and set up real-time monitoring.
### Details:
Work with stakeholders to set acceptable thresholds for execution time, memory, and resource usage. Integrate monitoring dashboards and alerting for budget violations. Document budgets and ensure all teams are aware of constraints.

## 10. Performance-First API and Pattern Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and document API and architectural patterns that prioritize performance.
### Details:
Create guidelines for API design that minimize overhead, encourage streaming and batching, and avoid common performance pitfalls. Review all new APIs and patterns for compliance with performance-first principles.

## 11. Early Performance Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and integrate a performance testing framework from the start of the project.
### Details:
Select or build a performance testing toolchain, integrate it into CI/CD, and ensure all new code is covered by automated performance tests. Provide documentation and training for developers to write and interpret performance tests.
