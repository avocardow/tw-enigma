# Task ID: 17
# Title: Develop backup mechanism for modified files
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to automatically backup files before modification.
# Details:
1. Extend src/fileIntegrity.js
2. Implement function to create file backups
3. Generate unique backup filenames
4. Implement cleanup of old backups
5. Add restore function for rollback scenarios
6. Optimize for space efficiency with large projects

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for backup creation, naming, and restoration

# Subtasks:
## 1. Backup Creation Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core backup creation logic, ensuring data integrity and error handling.
### Details:
Define the scope of data to be backed up, select appropriate backup methods (full, incremental, differential), and implement automated backup routines. Ensure robust error handling and logging for backup operations. Validate that backups are created successfully and are complete.

## 2. Unique Backup Naming Scheme [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop and enforce a unique naming convention for backup files to prevent collisions and enable easy identification.
### Details:
Design a naming scheme that incorporates timestamps, source identifiers, and backup type. Implement logic to generate and apply unique names during backup creation. Validate that naming is consistent and prevents overwrites.

## 3. Backup Cleanup and Retention Policy [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Implement automated cleanup routines to manage backup retention and free up storage space.
### Details:
Define retention policies (e.g., number of backups to keep, age-based deletion). Implement scheduled cleanup scripts that safely remove outdated or excess backups. Ensure that cleanup does not interfere with active or in-progress backups.

## 4. Restore Functionality Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Create and validate the restore process to recover data from backups reliably.
### Details:
Develop restore routines that can select and recover data from specific backup files. Implement verification steps to ensure restored data matches the original. Handle errors and partial restores gracefully.

## 5. Backup Space Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Optimize storage usage for backups through compression, deduplication, and efficient file management.
### Details:
Evaluate and implement compression algorithms and deduplication strategies. Monitor storage usage and adjust backup strategies as needed to maximize efficiency. Document and automate optimization processes.

## 6. Comprehensive Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5
### Description: Thoroughly test all backup and restore functionalities, including edge cases and failure scenarios.
### Details:
Develop and execute test cases for backup creation, unique naming, cleanup, restore, and space optimization. Simulate failures and verify error handling. Validate that all requirements are met and document test results.
