# Task ID: 19
# Title: Develop integration tests with project fixtures
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive suite of integration tests using real project fixtures.
# Details:
1. Set up test environment with Jest@29.5.0
2. Create test/fixtures directory with sample projects
3. Implement end-to-end test scenarios
4. Test with various frameworks (React, Next.js, Vite)
5. Validate output files and optimizations
6. Measure and assert performance metrics

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end tests with real project structures and full optimization pipeline

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Test Environment Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and document all hardware, software, and network requirements needed for the test environment
### Details:
Create a comprehensive document outlining hardware specifications (servers, storage, network), software components (OS, databases, middleware, application servers), and network configurations that mirror production. Include version requirements and compatibility considerations.

## 2. Set Up Test Environment Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Provision and configure all hardware, software, and network components based on requirements
### Details:
Install required operating systems, databases, application servers, and middleware with matching versions to production. Configure network settings, storage, and ensure all components are properly integrated. Implement infrastructure as code where possible for reproducibility.

## 3. Create Test Data and Fixtures [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Develop comprehensive test data sets and fixtures that cover all testing scenarios
### Details:
Generate sample data that mimics real-world scenarios, including edge cases. Create test fixtures that initialize the system to known states before test execution. Document all test data sources, generation methods, and expected outcomes for validation purposes.

## 4. Implement Test Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Develop detailed test scenarios covering all functional and non-functional requirements
### Details:
Create test cases for unit, integration, system, and performance testing. Document step-by-step procedures, expected outcomes, and validation criteria for each scenario. Ensure coverage of normal operations, edge cases, and error conditions.

## 5. Configure Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Set up and configure testing tools and frameworks for automated test execution
### Details:
Install and configure testing tools like Selenium, JUnit, or other appropriate frameworks. Set up continuous integration pipelines for automated test execution. Create test harnesses and utilities to support test execution and reporting.

## 6. Implement Validation Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4, 19.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive validation methods to verify test outputs against expected results
### Details:
Create validation scripts and assertions to verify test outputs. Implement logging mechanisms to capture test execution details. Develop error handling and reporting mechanisms to identify and categorize test failures.

## 7. Set Up Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.5
### Description: Implement tools and processes to measure and analyze system performance during testing
### Details:
Configure performance monitoring tools to capture metrics like response time, throughput, and resource utilization. Set up dashboards for real-time performance visualization. Define performance baselines and thresholds for pass/fail criteria.

## 8. Establish Reporting Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.6, 19.7
### Description: Create comprehensive reporting mechanisms for test results and analysis
### Details:
Develop templates for test execution reports, defect reports, and performance analysis. Configure automated reporting tools to generate reports after test execution. Implement dashboards for real-time visibility into test progress and results.
